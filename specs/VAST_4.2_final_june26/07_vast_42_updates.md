# VAST 4.2 updates

The updates included in VAST 4.2 are summarized here:

- Support for Secure Interactive Media Interface Definition (SIMID). SIMID is the replacement for VPAID to support interactive use cases. More information available at this blog post by the IAB Tech Lab. This includes a new tracking event and an error code 902.
- Allow ClickThrough element to be specified in a wrapper to better enable the use case defined in 2.3.5 (managing assets with an ad cloud)
- Added error code 206 to support use cases where the player might decide not to play an ad (for example during live broadcasts where the break needed to be shortened at the last moment).
- Allow multiple UniversalAdID nodes to be provided
- Updates to Icon and Icon ClickFallbackImages
- New macros for better adbreak info.
