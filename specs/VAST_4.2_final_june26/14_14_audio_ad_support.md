## 1.4 Audio Ad Support

DAAST, the Digital Audio Ad Serving Template was developed in 2014 as a spin-off of VAST 3.0 to support Audio ads. DAAST is now being merged back into VAST4, though the name of the standard will continue to be VAST for the moment.

The main changes are on the VAST "Ad" element (to include an "adType" attribute), some minor additions (identified below), using the term "media player" instead of "video player", and instructions on handling various VAST elements/attributes when in an Audio Ad scenario.

### 1.4.1 Audio Player Use Cases:

Audio players may also support video and display ads but have the additional complexity of being able to run in the background. This means that there are various modes in which ads might be used and need to be well understood.

1. Audio only ads
2. Audio ads with Companion Ads
3. Audio ad provided through a video creative, expected to play as audio only mode
4. Video ad trafficked as audio first, but with the potential to be seen for additional impact.

### 1.4.2 "Audibility" / Viewability:

Discussions are still ongoing about the concept of "Audible Impression", and will be added later.
