## 3.2.1 Error (VAST)

TOC Schema

Used to report a no-ad response. When the ad server does not or cannot return an Ad, the VAST response should contain only the root `<VAST>` element with one or more `<Error>` elements, as shown below:

```xml
<VAST version="4.1">
    <Error>
        <![CDATA[http://adserver.com/noad.gif]]>
    </Error>
</VAST>
```

The VAST `<Error>` element is optional but if included, the media player must use the URI provided to notify the server that no ad was returned. Multiple `<Error>` elements may be provided to notify multiple parties of the no-ad response.

| Player Support | Required |
|---|---|
| Required in response | No, but if supplied no other elements are allowed |
| Parent | VAST |
| Bounded | 0+ |
| Content | A URI supplied by the ad server and used to report the no ad response |
