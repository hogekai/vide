## 2.3.1 VAST Ad Types

VAST covers several distinct ad types, but ad serving and publisher organizations may not want to support all formats. For example, some vendors may choose to serve only linear ads with companions.

VAST 3.0 introduced five ad types for compliance so that organizations may be compliant with VAST while only supporting a selected subset of the ad types.

The VAST-compliant ad types are as follows:

1. Linear Ads
2. NonLinear Ads
3. Companion Ads
4. Skippable Linear Ads
5. Ad Pods

A company wishing to display IAB's seal for VAST compliance must declare which of the five ad types their technology supports.

Note – all ad types are relevant for "audio only" ads except NonLinear ads.
