## 3.11 Icons

TOC Schema

The industry icon feature was defined in VAST 3.0 to support initiatives such as privacy programs. An example of such a program is the AdChoices program for interest-based advertising (IBA). Though the VAST icon feature was initially created to support privacy programs, it was designed to support other programs that require posting an icon with the linear ad.

This feature is only offered for Linear Ads because icons can be easily inserted in NonLinear ads and companion creative using existing features. Icon source files may also be included in a wrapper if necessary.

The structure for Linear icons uses the `<Icons>` element (plural) as a container for one or more `<Icon>` elements (singular). Each `<Icon>` element provides containers for the creative resource file in section 3.11.1. Icon tracking is described in sections 3.11.2 to 3.11.6.

See section 7.5 for details about industry icon support in VAST.

| width | Pixel width of the icon asset. |
| height | Pixel height of the icon asset. |

### 3.11.6 IconClickFallbackImages

TOC Schema

The `<IconClickFallbackImages>` element is used to provide information disclosure for platforms which do not support HTML rendering, by baking the information into an image. This is a fallback for when the buyer cannot rely on `<IconClickThrough>` for disclosure. When an icon click occurs, the ad must pause and the image must be rendered above the video. The player must provide a means for the user to close the dialogue, for example by pressing the back button. The image must not be obstructed and should not be downloaded unless a click-action occurs.
