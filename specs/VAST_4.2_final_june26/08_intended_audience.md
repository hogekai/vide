I notice you've provided instructions for cleaning up a PDF-to-Markdown conversion, but the actual content at the end is very short and seems incomplete — it's just a small fragment about a VAST document's intended audience section.

Following the critical rules, here is the output as-is:

## Intended Audience

This document was designed for digital video and audio technologists who either develop players that accept digital in-stream ads or for vendors who develop ads to be sent to digital in-stream players.

For engineers, section defines all the VAST XML elements. Section includes a "human-readable" schema for quick reference with links to more details in the document if needed. Section defines VAST compliance and section provides technical tips for migrating to VAST 4.x.

For executives, the executive summary and section provide high-level explanation of how VAST can be used to streamline digital video or audio ad operations.
