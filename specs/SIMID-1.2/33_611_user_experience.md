## 6.11. User Experience

Both ad creatives and media players should ensure that consumers are presented with a good ad experience.

This specification does not define the user experience for a close control (close button) or other generic media interaction behavior by the ad creative or the media player. The publisher media player is in full control over its user experience and can present its controls (or hide them) as needed. The publisher media player may dismiss the ad creative at any point in time. Some implementations may have a publisher provided close control, as well as various other controls, and others may not.

The ad creative can also request to be dismissed at any point in time. An ad creative may opt to show its own controls, including a close control.
