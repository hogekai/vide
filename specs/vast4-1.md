## Executive Summary

The Video Ad Serving Template or VAST is a template for structuring ad tags that serve
video and audio ads to media players. Using an XML schema, VAST transfers important
metadata about an ad from the ad server to a media player. Initially launched in 2008,
VAST has since played an important role in the growth of the digital video and audio
marketplace.
The early days of video consisted mostly of shared videos and other user-generated
content. Success in monetizing this content with ads has produced the resources to
improve the digital video marketplace. However, digital video has met a number of
challenges along the way.
One challenge, and a key reason some video publishers avoid using VAST, is a lack of
quality control. Along with the IAB Video Player-Ad Interface Definition (VPAID), VAST can
deliver ads programmatically or include ads with complex interactions. If a player isn't
programmed to accept VPAID ads, the ad cannot be executed. Even when the player does
accept VPAID ads, performance may be slow and cause latency in load times. In the
meantime, the audience experiences a delay or a malfunction in their viewing experience.
Publishers and ad vendors need a way to separate the video file from its interactive
components to ensure that ads play in systems that cannot execute the interactive
components. These ads should also execute more efficiently in players that are equipped to
handle the interactions.
Another challenge, especially for broadcasters who are moving their content online, is the
lack of a consistent identifier for creative that is maintained across systems. VAST offers a
creative identifier, but it has been used inconsistently and one creative may use different
identifiers for every system it passes through. A system-wide identifier is a requirement for
broadcasters trying to maintain control over the ads they play.
VAST 4 has addressed these challenges along with a few others. As players begin to adopt
the updates in VAST 4.x, digital video and audio can expect to see smoother operation and
the continued growth that results.
The updates made in VAST 4.0 and the challenges they address are summarized here:
- Separate Video File and Interactive File: The complexity of digital video has given
rise to the need to separate the linear video file from any creative interactive API
files. While the VAST media file has accepted a variety of media files in the past,
interactive APIs cannot always be executed. A VAST tag that provides the video file
separate from APIs can display more successfully across platforms and devices.
- Server-Side Ad Insertion Support: While client-side ad execution and tracking has
been the recommended way to track ad impressions and other metrics, digital in-
stream video and audio ads are often served to devices (clients) that cannot execute
and track ads using traditional display methods. VAST 4 supports the increasingly
common “ad-stitching” method for stitching linear ads into a video or audio content
stream and sending it to players with limited capabilities.
- Mezzanine File: To support advertising across video platforms that include long-
form content and high-resolution screens, VAST 4 features include support for the
raw, high-quality mezzanine file. The mezzanine file is very large and cannot be
used for ad display, but ad-stitching services and other ad vendor use it to generate
files at appropriate quality levels for the environment in which they play.
- Ready-to-Serve Files: Along with support for including the mezzanine file, VAST 4
provides guidance on providing three ready-to-serve media files, each at different
quality levels, to ensure that a linear video/audio ad can always play. The IAB Digital
Video Ad Format Guidelines offers guidance on video/audio file specifications for
linear ads.
- Universal Ad ID: While VAST has offered a creative identifier in the past, it has
been used inconsistently. The new Universal Ad ID feature is used specifically for
including a creative identifier that is maintained across systems. The existing adId
attribute for creative can still be used to log creative IDs specific to the server.
- Ad Verification and Viewability Execution: Verification vendors have been using
VPAID for measurement verification instead of using it for ad interaction as VPAID
was intended. VAST 4 offers a designated space (`<AdVerifications>`) for inserting
ad verification APIs, enabling a more streamlined process for executing files strictly
intended for ad verification. Open Measurement (OM) is expected to be used for this
purpose. In addition, a secondary impression element, the `<ViewableImpression>`
element, has been added to allow publishers the option to track viewability on their
inventory.
- Support for Categories: Ad categories help publishers separate competing ad
creative and improve brand safety. VAST 4 ad categories support these efforts.
- Conditional Ad Declaration: In programmatic environments, a VPAID unit is
sometimes used to decide whether or not to place an ad. If this “conditional ad”
never results in an ad to display, the publisher may have to forfeit any revenue from
the resulting lost inventory. A declaration in VAST for a conditional ad helps
publishers prevent and reclaim any potentially lost inventory revenue in
programmatic ad delivery. (Note - Deprecated as of VAST 4.1)
- New Error Codes: Along with support for the mezzanine file and other new features,
added error codes provide additional troubleshooting support.
- Standardized Timestamp: Trackers used in VAST often include timestamp macros,
but its use has not been consistent. In VAST 4, the [TIMESTAMP] macro and the
format for time has been standardized to enable more consistent time-sensitive
tracking.
The updates made in VAST 4.1 are summarized here:
- Verification: Changes that enable verification to be supported in a non-VPAID
architecture (separated from media file). Also includes changes required to work with
Open Measurement.
- Digital Audio Ad Serving Template (DAAST): With VAST 4.1, DAAST has been
merged into VAST. This mostly involves providing direction in places where audio
ads might need to be treated differently. The main change is an optional “adType”
added to the “Ad” element to support the various audio use cases.
- Ad Requests: VAST is a response protocol. 4.1 now includes a basic Ad Request
specification, based on macros.
- Updates to Macros: With the new Ad Requests proposal, the Macros section has
been completely revamped and updated.
- Server Side Ad Insertion (SSAI) related changes: VAST 4.1 includes minor
changes to how headers should be handled. The “Ad Request” section is also
relevant to SSAI use cases.
- Deprecating Video Player Ad-Serving Interface Definition (VPAID): While VPAID
will likely be in use for some more time, with VAST 4.1 we are taking the first steps
to officially deprecate the use of VPAID. The apiFramework attribute on MediaFile,
and the conditionalAd attribute on the Ad element are being deprecated.
- Updates to Tracking Events: Added “loaded”, “closeLinear” (back from VAST 3.0).
Removed acceptInvitationLinear and timeSpentViewing
- AdServingId: A required field has been added to simplify comparing data about a
video impression across the various systems involved with the delivery and tracking
of the impression.
- VAST Interactive Templates: Recognizing the need for standardizing interactive
ads without ad delivered executable code, VAST 4.1 introduces the concept of
interactive templates, with End-Cards as an example template.
- Closed Captioning: VAST 4.1 enables Closed Captioning by standardizing the
delivery of Closed Captioning files.
- Flash: Following up on the white paper to transition video ads from flash to HTML5
(https://iabtechlab.com/html5videotransition/) with VAST 4.1, all references to Flash
and Flash resources are being removed.
- Survey: The survey node is being deprecated as of VAST 4.1.
- Other Updates:
o MediaFile fixes - fixes to UniversalAdId, added support for more types,
changed bounding of Mezzanine files, added support for fileSize etc.
o Added id attribute to “Advertiser” element
o Added “Expires” element
o Added variableDuration to InteractiveCreativeFile
Note - based on feedback received during public comment, the group decided not to
deprecate nonlinear ads in VAST 4.1. However, we will continue to explore this format
further to determine if the use cases are better handled with other options.

## 1 General Overview

VAST is used to send in-stream ad details to a media player. Historically, the player (client)
has received, executed, and tracked streaming video or audio ads. However, with the
increase in player devices, the player is often unable to execute anything more than a single
stream of content. Players might have compensated for this by using one player for content
and loading a secondary player for ad playback. After ad playback, the original player would
be reloaded for resuming content playback. This process caused a brief buffering period
between player loads.
The solution that has emerged for this challenge is a service that involves inserting ads into
a stream of content for the player. The result is a seamless experience for the viewer along
with the ability to select ads dynamically for insertion and more sophisticated tracking
options.
VAST 4.x includes support for high-quality video formats necessary for long-form video
content and server-side tracking for use when ad-stitching is leveraged to reach devices
that cannot use client-side tracking methods. Version 4.x also allows embedding optional
scripts for viewability and ad verification.
### 1.1 VAST Ad Serving and Tracking

Display advertising uses standardized browser technology to request and execute ads.
However, digital in-stream video and audio advertising operates on players, sometimes built
with proprietary code. As a template for ads served to a media player, VAST offers a set of
instructions for developers on how to program their players to process VAST-formatted ads.
Using VAST, ad servers can serve ads to any VAST-compliant player regardless of what
code the player uses.
#### 1.1.1 Client-Side Ad Serving

VAST is a unidirectional means of sending ad details to a media player. Built as a layer on
top of browser technology, the VAST process that uses client-side execution looks
something like this:
1. VAST Request: At some point during content playback, either before (pre-roll), in
the middle of (mid-roll), or after (post-roll), the player reaches a cue to insert an ad
and uses HTTP to send the request for an ad. See section 1.1.1 on sending an ad
request. The request is sent to the primary ad server, which may be the publisher’s
ad server or a supply-side platform (SSP).
2. * Wrapper Response: The primary server responds with VAST. This response is
either an InLine response or a Wrapper response. If the server can fill the ad
request, it sends an InLine response (step 4). In many cases, the ad server redirects
the player to a secondary server using a Wrapper response.
3. Secondary VAST Request: If a Wrapper response is received, the player makes a
secondary request to another server. The secondary response may be an InLine
response or another VAST Wrapper.
4. InLine Response: Eventually, after a series of requests and responses, an ad
server provides an InLine response.
5. InLine Execution: The media player executes the VAST response.
6. Tracking: At key points during ad playback, tracking information is sent for both the
InLine and Wrapper responses that the player received. In traditional client-side ad
serving, cookies are used to track ads and the computers on which they play.
#### 1.1.2 Server-Side Ad Stitching

The example just described the general process for serving an ad directly to a media player,
the client, and uses client-side tracking. With client-side tracking, the player sends tracking
information. However, in today’s wide array of streaming media players the player may not
be capable of executing dynamic ad responses or tracking impressions and interactions. In
these cases, an intermediary server is needed to insert ads dynamically into the video or
audio stream.
Called ad stitching (or stream stitching, ad insertion, etc.), the process looks something like
this:
1. VAST Request: The publisher sends an ad request to the ad-stitching service.
2. Request VAST: The ad-stitching service makes a request to the ad server for a
VAST tag.
3. Send VAST: The ad server sends a VAST tag with a mezzanine file and ready-to-
serve files. If the ad stitching service has already received the creative for a previous
request and has transcoded the mezzanine file, or the ready-to-serve files are
already in the format required to be stitched into the content stream, then it moves
on to step 5. If the VAST tag response is a Wrapper tag then the ad-stitching
service should extract the inner InLine response using the same precedence logic as
a client-side media player.
4. *Extract Mezzanine and Transcode: The ad-stitching service pulls the unique
creative identifier from the VAST tag. If the creative has never been used in the
system, the mezzanine file is extracted and transcoded. In this scenario, the ad is
skipped and the next available ad is played instead. VAST error code 407 is sent.
5. Select Transcoded: If the creative in the VAST tag from step 3 matches the unique
creative identifier for an ad that has already been transcoded, the ad-stitching
service selects the pre-transcoded file already in the system.
6. Stitch Ad into Content Stream: The ad-stitching service stitches the ad into the
content stream and serves the content and ad to the player in one continuous
stream.
Ad-stitching vendors rely on a unique creative identifier for managing the mezzanine source
file and its cache of transcoded files for stitching into a video or audio stream. If the ad
creative is changed in any way, it should be served with a new creative identifier. In VAST
4.x, the unique creative identifier is provided in the `<UniversalAdId>` element under

```xml
<Creative>. See section 3.7.1 for details.
```

#### 1.1.3 Headers in Server-to-Server Ad Requests and Ad Tracking

With client-side ad tracking described in section 1.1.2, the player (client) sends tracking
included in the VAST tag and uses cookies to determine which computers executed the ad.
However, in server-to-server and server-side ad-stitching, the player may not be able to
process ad tracking, and the ad-stitching service cannot access cookies used in traditional
client-side tracking. Instead, the ad-stitching service must identify devices where ads play
by a combination of other methods.
When an ad-stitching service is involved, the ad-stitching server may send tracking on the
player’s behalf. This server-to-server tracking process is problematic because all the
tracking is coming from one IP address. To an ad server that is receiving tracking
information, the reports look similar to invalid traffic. In addition, the server is initiating the
request on behalf of the client, so it is important to separate information describing the
server itself from information describing the client.
Note - For server-side VAST requests prior to version 4.1, namely VAST 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0,
the immediate goal is to standardize the ad requests and impression calls from the
publisher server (including SSAI platforms) which make the ad request to SSPs, ad
exchanges and DSPs. To this end, the publisher server or the SSAI platform may use
existing HTTP GET tag requests, on condition that they send the following additional HTTP
headers. The goal here is to provide SSAI technology providers the runway to make the
transition to the recommended macros based request model (Section 1.5) which has
comprehensive support for this use case, while still allowing for adjustments for the
immediate term.
In the future, ad requests will move to a POST based model, which has performance and
scaling implications, so the working group recommends that platforms start working on
understanding architectural changes required to support POST messages at scale.
To avoid being mistaken as fraudulent traffic, ad stitching providers must include with their
ad tracking requests the following HTTP headers:
X-Device-IP set to the IP address of the device on whose behalf this request is being
made.
X-Device-User-Agent set to the User-Agent of the client on whose behalf the
request is being made.
The requester should also include the following headers, if available:
X-Device-Referer set to the Referer header value that the client would have used
when making a request itself.
X-Device-Accept-Language set to the Accept-Language header value that the
client would have used when making a request itself.
The requester may also include the following headers:
X-Forwarded-For for backwards compatibility, although this is now deprecated.
X-Device-* Other HTTP headers that the client would have sent itself may be
forwarded as well by the requester using the X-Device- prefix.
example: X-Forwarded-For:192.1.1.1,72.2.2.2
The information included in these headers must match the information in the original ad
request payload, per section 1.1.1.
While these recommendations for tracking support server-side tracking, IAB Impression
Measurement Guidelines developed with the Media Rating Council (MRC) favor client-side
tracking. "The Measurement Guidelines require ad counting to use a client-initiated
approach; server-initiated ad counting methods (the configuration in which impressions are
counted at the same time the underlying page content is served) are not acceptable for
counting ad impressions because they are the furthest away from the user actually seeing
the ad. Measurement counting may happen at the server side as long as it is initiated based
on client-side events and measurement assets. However, pass-through methods (where
client-initiated measurement is passed to server-side collection) of signaling interactions
detected on the client side from server infrastructure are acceptable." Source: MMTF Public
Comment Draft v2 Oct 2017.
In general, an ad-stitching service may have little or no control over ad play once the ad is
stitched into the content and streamed to the client. Impression reporting may vary by
implementation. For the ad stitching service in situations where the client cannot count
impressions, an impression could be reported as the ad is sent on the stitched stream and
therefore be as close as possible to the opportunity to play. Alternately, a session-oriented
ad-stitching service may report impressions from a given session at session completion.
However, any impression measurement beyond the ad-stitched stream is out of the ad-
stitching services’ control and should be counted by the player whenever possible.
Auditing for compliance with IAB Viewable Ad Impression Measurement Guidelines should
focus on disclosing the process by which impressions are counted and any limitations with
reporting impressions in certain situations and environments.
See section 2.3.3 for more information on tracking.
### 1.2 Ad Verification

VPAID, the Video Player-Ad Interface Definition, was originally designed to support
interactive ads that controlled the entirety of creative execution. As this was, at the time, the
only way to execute code at impression time, ad verification services adopted VPAID in
order to run code that verifies and measures playback (including viewability).
An unfortunate side effect of this approach is that, rather than simply enabling monitoring of
player-controlled video playback, responsibility for creative rendering is placed on the
verification service. In many cases, multiple data-collection VPAID "wrappers" may be used,
leading to a fragile chain of intermediaries in the critical path which can significantly delay
page rendering and create a negative experience for the viewer.
#### 1.2.1 Loading Verification Resources

In order to support verification with minimal impact to performance, VAST 4 separates
media resources from those intended for measurement.
The `<AdVerifications>` element provides a place for verification vendors to specify their
executable resources and related metadata, as described in section 3.16. The IAB Tech Lab
strongly recommends using code that supports the Open Measurement Interface Definition
(OMID) for this purpose, and strongly against using VPAID (which is being retired). OMID
has been designed from the ground up to support the needs of verification efficiently, while
providing a level of flexibility and transparency that was unavailable in previous VAST
generations.
See section 3.16 for details.
### 1.3 Long-Form Video Support

Long-form video is the extension of traditional broadcast networks to digital mediums. To
enable video advertising across screens that include TV content, the response framework in
VAST needs to reduce the challenges faced in this digital video environment. Specifically,
VAST needs to support the following features:
- Server-to-server ad stitching
- Availability of the high-quality source (mezzanine) file for the ad
- A unique identifier that follows creative and related data from system to system
#### 1.3.1 High-Quality Video

Previous versions of VAST have allowed for multiple media files so that the media player
can poll for the file best suited to the environment where the ad will play. However, the high
standards for quality in long-form video need more than a few options.
VAST 4.x includes a media container for the mezzanine file, which is the raw high-quality
video file that the publisher can use to produce the best quality file where needed. In
addition to the mezzanine file, VAST 4.x requires either an adaptive stream ready-to-serve
file or a minimum of three media files at different levels of quality: high, medium, and low.
Identifying the quality levels of three media files enables the media player to more quickly
find the appropriate file needed for a given environment. A separate document, the IAB
Digital Video Ad Format Guidelines, is provided for ad developers and outlines encoding
recommendations for each of these files.
See section 3.9 for details.
In order to support additional formats such as 3D, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality
(VR), 360-degree video, etc., more than one mezzanine file may be included, with a “type”
attribute to help identify the type of mezzanine file.
#### 1.3.2 Unique Creative Identification

As ad creatives move from system to system, they become more difficult to track and
impressions involving these creatives become difficult to reconcile in reports from different
systems. Historically, VAST has provided a placeholder for a creative id, but its purpose has
been unclear and its use varies under different vendors and use cases.
In VAST 4.x, the placeholder for a unique creative ID has been pulled out into a new
element to draw more attention to it and provide attributes that more clearly define the id.
The new `<UniversalAdId>` element is required for linear ads and consists of an attribute for
defining the idRegistry and the value of the ID specified in the content of the node.
Using a unique creative identifier enables all data associated with the creative to follow
across systems. Unifying data under a unique ID streamlines data collection operations,
reporting, and analysis.
See section 3.7.1 for details.
### 1.4 Audio Ad Support

DAAST, the Digital Audio Ad Serving Template was developed in 2014 as a spin-off of
VAST 3.0 to support Audio ads. DAAST is now being merged back into VAST4, though the
name of the standard will continue to be VAST for the moment.
The main changes are on the VAST “Ad” element (to include an “adType" attribute), some
minor additions (identified below), using the term “media player” instead of “video player”,
and instructions on handling various VAST elements/attributes when in an Audio Ad
scenario.
#### 1.4.1 Audio Player Use Cases:

Audio players may also support video and display ads but have the additional complexity of
being able to run in the background. This means that there are various modes in which ads
might be used and need to be well understood.
1. Audio only ads
2. Audio ads with Companion Ads
3. Audio ad provided through a video creative, expected to play as audio only mode
4. Video ad trafficked as audio first, but with the potential to be seen for additional
impact.
#### 1.4.2 “Audibility” / Viewability:

Discussions are still ongoing about the concept of “Audible Impression”, and will be added
later.
### 1.5 VAST Ad Requests

VAST is a response protocol. Historically, the request mechanism was not discussed in the
VAST specs, even though the request is important since it contains the information needed
by the ad server to respond with a VAST response. The protocols used for ad requests vary
based on the type of inventory being served.
- For programmatic ad slots, OpenRTB is the standard typically used for ad requests,
and the OpenRTB response could include a VAST response.
- For non-programmatic scenarios, the ad requests are currently not based on any
standard and are proprietary agreements between the publishers and ad servers.
Typically this would consist of an HTTP GET request, with additional data passed in
the URL in the path or in query parameters in a key=value format. This is generally a
mix of platform-specific parameters, as well as information that is commonly required
across the industry, such as device IDs, contextual information such as domain or
app ID, or details of the position of the video in video content.
In spite of many ad servers sharing requirements for this common data, passing this
information is extremely difficult, as ad servers often accept these values in different
formats. Additionally they are generally passed along VAST Wrapper chains using ad
server macros which populate at the time a VAST Wrapper document is generated. This
means if data must be passed from ad server A to ad server B to ad server C along a
wrapper chain, traffickers in both A and B must traffic proprietary tags properly and have
values align, otherwise data will be dropped.
Often necessary common data is missing by the time a final ad server is reached, causing
either loss of the opportunity or selection of a suboptimal ad. To mitigate this, some
standardization of request values, settable by the VAST client, is needed.
With VAST 4.1, a first step will be made towards a request protocol in VAST. To ensure
ease of adoption given the current industry setting of proprietary ad tag parameters on
HTTP GET requests, the request protocol will focus entirely on ensuring an agreed-upon
set of values that VAST clients can set, and which all ad servers should accept. Future
versions of VAST will go further, to define a full request protocol based on AdCOM
(reference OpenRTB 3.0) which will define request structure as well as values.
As a further note, this standard will also hold when requests are made for VMAP, as
requests for VMAP often result in VAST documents populated in the VMAP response. As
such, these values are equally needed at VMAP request time.
To allow VAST clients to set values in ad tags, the VAST macro concept will be expanded
to apply not just to tracking URIs, but to AdTagURIs in Wrapper creatives, as well as to
initial ad tags URIs passed to a VAST client for the ad initial request.
The list of macros (for both VAST Ad Requests as well as for tracking) has been
consolidated in Section 6.
### 1.6 VAST Interactive Templates

While interactive video ads command a premium, they are not supported on all platforms or
by all publishers. While this is partly due to concerns around VPAID, which are being
addressed by VAST4 and the replacement for VPAID, the execution of unknown code may
never be allowed in many cases. To address this, VAST 4.1 introduces the concept of
“VAST Interactive Templates”. These are interactive experiences that only require some
visual assets (images, css, etc.) and some instructions/metadata in the VAST tag. The
publisher implements the interactive code and uses the metadata to run the interactive ad.
In VAST 4.1 we have included an “end-card” (Section 3.13) based on a use case that has
already been informally implemented in the industry. We expect to add more such
templates in the future.
Note - The IAB Tech Lab recommends the use of VAST extensions for the industry to
experiment with such experiences, and then bring in proposals to the Digital Video
Technical Working Group to formalize them as standard templates.
### 1.7 Flash Support

As indicated in the Flash to HTML5 transition guidance released by the IAB Tech Lab in
December 2016, all Flash references are considered deprecated as of January 2017.
VAST4 is now officially being updated to reflect that position by removing all Flash related
references
### 1.8 Handling MediaFile Nodes During the Transition from

VPAID
One of the goals of VAST4 is to eliminate the practice of using the MediaFile node to deliver
executable code (usually VPAID). To achieve this goal, the AdVerifications Node and the
InteractiveCreativeFile were added in VAST 4, so that executable code for measurement
and for interactivity could be delivered separately from the MediaFile. Open Measurement is
the planned replacement of VPAID for verification/measurement use cases, and the working
group is developing a replacement for VPAID focused on interactivity. (Refer to
http://bit.ly/videoAdVision for more information). With VAST 4.1, the working group has also
deprecated the “apiFramework” attribute on the MediaFile node, which enables the delivery
of VPAID.
However, at the time of release of VAST 4.1, Open Measurement does not cover the VPAID
use case for Brand Safety/Blocking. Also, the interactivity focused replacement for VPAID
has not been released. For these reasons, as well as general adoption times for new
protocols, there will be a transition period where VPAID remains in use. During the
transition period, VAST 4.1 tags will likely have both the AdVerifications node for Open
Measurement, alongside a VPAID MediaFile element.
This section provides recommendations for both publishers and tag creators to help during
this transition period-
For VAST tag creators (both direct as well as wrapped tags):
VAST tag creators should plan to deliver the relevant VAST content based on information in
the ad requests (OpenRTB and via VAST ad request macros - refer section 1.5 and 5). Use
the APIFRAMEWORKS macro.
1. When OMID support is indicated in the request, include the AdVerifications node (or
extensions node with type AdVerifications for pre VAST 4.1) to include verification
scripts.
2. If VPAID support is indicated in the request and the tag creator requires VPAID
support (for interactivity or ad blocking), include the following in the VAST tag
a. The AdVerifications node (or extensions node with type AdVerifications for
pre VAST 4.1)
b. The VPAID file type MediaFile node (for Blocking or Interactivity)
3. If OMID/VPAID support status is not known and there is no hard requirement on
VPAID use from the buyer, ensure that the VAST tag contains all 3 of the following
so that the publisher has all resources available:
a. The AdVerifications node (or extensions node with type AdVerifications for
pre VAST 4.1)
b. The VPAID file type MediaFile node (for Blocking or Interactivity)
c. One or more non-VPAID (video creative) MediaFile nodes.
For Publishers
For best results, send information in the ad request (OpenRTB and VAST ad request
macros) about capabilities of the video player. Use the APIFRAMEWORKS macro.
Based on the standards supported, execute in this order for best results
1. If OMID is supported, run the AdVerifications node (for Open Measurement) - and
the video creative MediaFile
2. If OMID is not supported but VPAID is supported and VPAID MediaFile node is
available in VAST tag, run VPAID
3. If OMID and VPAID are supported, run both AdVerifications node and VPAID
4. If OMID and VPAID not supported, run one of the non-VPAID MediaFile nodes.
The above is only a recommendation and might not work in all cases. Publishers can decide
to run any MediaFile they deem appropriate for their use cases, so as always, please
ensure that your integrations are working as expected and per your business agreements.
Also, publishers and technology vendors are responsible for testing the various
combinations above and ensure that potential issues like double counting or namespace
clashes are correctly handled.
Once Open Measurement supports Brand Safety and once the interactivity replacement for
VPAID is defined (and is delivered via the InteractiveCreative Node) the use of “VPAID-
MediaFile” will be eliminated.
## 2 VAST Compliance

Compliance is a two-party effort that involves, at a minimum, the media player and the ad
server. Both must meet certain expectations so that VAST can be truly interoperable and
encourage growth in the marketplace.
General Open Measurement, VPAID and VMAP specs are excluded from VAST compliance
Implementation because these specs are independent of each other and of VAST. Compliance with one
Note spec does not imply compliance with any of the other specs. Compliance for either spec
must be separately declared.
### 2.1 Ad Server Expectations

VAST-compliant ad servers must be able to serve ad responses that conform to the VAST
XML schema defined in this document. Ad servers must also be able to receive the
subsequent tracking and error requests that result from the media player’s execution of the
VAST ad response. Tables for each VAST XML element define which are required in a
VAST response.
### 2.2 Media Player Expectations

VAST-compliant media players and SSAI systems must be able to play the ad in a VAST
response according to the instructions provided by the VAST ad response and according
the media player’s declared format support, which includes:
- Rendering the ad asset(s) correctly
- Respecting ad server instructions in a VAST response including those of any
subsequent ad servers called in a chain of VAST Wrapper responses, providing the
responses are VAST-compliant
- Responding to supported user-interactions
- Sending appropriate tracking information back to the ad server
- Supporting XML conventions such as standard comment syntax (i.e. acknowledge
VAST comments in the standard XML syntax: <!--comment-->)
Details for proper ad display and VAST support are defined throughout this document,
including player support requirement notes for each XML element.
### 2.3 General Compliance

VAST specifies both the format of the ad response and how the media player should handle
the response. In order for VAST to be effective, both ad servers and media players must
adopt the guidelines outlined in this document.
In general, the video player need only accept ads that it requests and ad server responses
should be displayed in the ad format intended.
For example, VAST allows for compliance while only supporting a subset of ad types
(described in section 2.3.1). For example, if a standard Linear Ad is requested but a
Skippable Linear Ad is received, the media player is not expected to display the Skippable
Linear Ad nor should the media player play the Skippable Ad as a Linear Ad (without skip
controls).
The following features must be supported for general functionality:
- Declaration of ad types
- XML structure
- Tracking
- Wrappers
- Error reporting
- Macros
- Industry icons
- Verification
These features are described in the following sections.
#### 2.3.1 VAST Ad Types

VAST covers several distinct ad types, but ad serving and publisher organizations may not
want to support all formats. For example, some vendors may choose to serve only linear
ads with companions.
VAST 3.0 introduced five ad types for compliance so that organizations may be compliant
with VAST while only supporting a selected subset of the ad types.
The VAST compliance ad types are as follows:
1. Linear Ads
2. NonLinear Ads
3. Companion Ads
4. Skippable Linear Ads
5. Ad Pods
A company wishing to display IAB’s seal for VAST compliance must declare which of the
five ad types their technology supports.
Note – all ad types are relevant for “audio only” ads except NonLinear ads.
#### 2.3.2 XML Structure

A VAST-compliant ad response is a well-formed XML document, compliant with XML 1.0 so
that standard XML requirements such as character entities and <!--XML comments-->
should be honored. It must also pass a schema check against the VAST 4.x XML Schema
Definition (XSD) that is distributed in conjunction with this document.
IAB Tech Lab Github URL for the XSD: https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/vast
Ad Server All URIs or any other free text fields containing potentially dangerous characters
> Implementation Note contained in the VAST document should be wrapped in CDATA blocks. The VAST
response should be carefully tested for appropriate treatment of URI characters that
require special handling.
#### 2.3.3 Encoding URIs for VAST

URIs provided in a VAST response must be CDATA-wrapped as in the following example:

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
<![CDATA[
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif
]]>
</Impression>
```

Wrapping the URI in a CDATA section enables most characters to be included as they are.
For example, without a CDATA section, the character & would need to be encoded as
&amp;. However, encoding this within a CDATA section double-encodes the URI.
Consider the CDATA wrapping needed for the following URI:
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?v=1&id=abc

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
<![CDATA[
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?v=1&amp;id=abc
]]>
</Impression>
```

The encoding of & into &amp; is not necessary in this example because the URI is enclosed
in a CDATA section. Characters in the URI that are also used to section out the URI with
CDATA may need extra encoding.
Consider the CDATA wrapping needed for the following URI:
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?s=x]]>x

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
<![CDATA[http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?s=x]]
]]>
<![CDATA[>]]>
x
</Impression>
```

The ]]> characters are used to close the CDATA section; therefore, the > character must
be enclosed in a secondary CDATA section. Since the x is harmless character at the end, it
can be left outside the CDATA section and will be concatenated with the other two URI
components, each closed in their CDATA sections.
Since CDATA-wrapping URIs is a requirement in VAST, the author of the VAST response
should carefully edit and test all included URIs, especially when input values require special
handling. Incorrect treatment of these characters may cause ad playback to fail or enable
content injection attacks.
Some additional examples are offered in the following table.
Impression URL: http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif
</Impression>
```

Not enclosed in a CDATA section

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
<![CDATA[http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif]]>
</Impression>
```

Correct and backwards compatible
Impression URL: http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?v=1&id=abc

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?v=1&amp;id=abc
</Impression>
```

The & is xml-encoded, but the URI needs to be wrapped in a CDATA block
Invalid -

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?v=1&id=abc
</Impression>
```

Not only is this URI not CDATA enclosed but the & is also not XML-encoded

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
<![CDATA[http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?v=1&amp;id=abc]]>
</Impression>
```

This URI is both CDATA-enclosed and the & is XML-encoded. The player will interpret the URI as:
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?v=1&amp;id=1234

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
<![CDATA[http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?v=1&id=abc]]>
</Impression>
```

This URI is properly wrapped in a CDATA block. The & doesn't need to be encoded.
Impression URL: http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?s=x]]>x

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?s=x]]&gt;x
</Impression>
```

Not enclosed in a CDATA section even though > is encoded

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?s=x]]>x
</Impression>
```

Not enclosed in a CDATA section

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
<![CDATA[http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?s=x]]>x]]>
</Impression>
```

CDATA section used but appears to end early because of the ]]> characters before the x, potentially allowing
content injection attacks

```xml
<Impression id="myserver">
<![CDATA[http://ad.server.com/impression/dot.gif?s=x]]]]>
<![CDATA[>]]>x
</Impression>
```

Correct and backwards compatible
Finally, a VAST-compliant ad response must conform to certain additional dependencies
that cannot be expressed in the VAST 4 XSD. For example, one ad type of either `<InLine>`
or `<Wrapper>` is allowed but not both. Another example is the protocol for providing 3 ready-
to-serve media files, ideally separate from any interactive components (see section 3.9). The
XSD can only validate for whether you’ve provided a URI under `<MediaFile>`; it cannot
validate whether the appropriate files have been provided. Such dependencies are further
described throughout this document.
#### 2.3.4 Tracking

VAST tracking is implemented using a number of individual tracking elements that map to
video events, such as video start or video completion. Each of these elements contains a
reference to a server-side resource, which historically has been an 1x1 pixel image, but
may also be a script or document reference. Calls to these resources are counted by the
ad server or other measurement vendor to tally up the total for a specific video event.
The publisher is responsible for making the server-side request associated with a
specific video event when that event occurs during video playback. These events
may originate from a client-side player, or (in some SSAI cases) from the publisher
Publisher
server. In the event the request comes from the publisher server extra care must
> Implementation Note
be taken to make sure that the calls are made concurrently with the corresponding
playback events, and any missing client-side information (user agent, etc) should
be passed along via headers or other mechanism.
The media player is required to request the resource file for any included tracking elements
from the URI provided at the appropriate times, or “fire” the tracking element. Advertisers
and publishers depend on accurate tracking records for billing, campaign effectiveness,
market analysis, and other important business intelligence and accounting. Good tracking
practices throughout the industry are important to the success and growth of digital video
and audio advertising.
General The publisher must send requests to the URIs provided in tracking elements;
> Implementation Note however, the publisher is not required to do anything with the response that is
returned. The response is only to acknowledge an event and to comply with the
HTTP protocol. This response is typically a 200 with a 1x1 pixel image in the
response body (although the response could be of any other type).
The use of multiple impression URIs enables the ad server to share impression-tracking
information with other ad serving systems, such as a vendor or partner ad server employed
by the advertiser. When multiple impression elements are included in a VAST response, the
media player is required to request all impressions at the same time or as close as possible
to the same time. Any significant delay between impression requests may result in count
discrepancies between ad serving systems.
If multiple `<Impression>` elements are provided, they must be requested at the
same moment in time or as close in time as possible. In particular for a VAST
Publisher
response containing a `<Linear>` element, compliance with the IAB Digital Video
> Implementation Note
Measurement Guidelines. If any of the requests are delayed significantly,
discrepancies may result in the counts of participating ad serving system.
#### 2.3.5 VAST Wrappers

Wrappers provide a way for one ad server to redirect a media player to another, secondary
ad server to retrieve an ad, multiple ads, or yet another VAST Wrapper.
One ad server may redirect to another for a variety of reasons:
- The first ad server has selected a specific advertiser campaign to fill the inventory. In
this case the redirect instructs the secondary ad server to return specific ads from a
particular ad campaign.
- The first ad server is delegating a specific piece of inventory for either a single ad or
an entire Pod of ads to the secondary ad server to fill with any ads that are within an
established agreement between the two parties.
- An ad server may wish to delegate delivery of the specific ad creative file(s) to a
separate asset repository/host (ad cloud).
- An ad server may have no ad to return and may return a redirect to a backfill
provider.
##### 2.3.5.1 Infinite Loops and Dead Ends

When serving an ad involves a chain of Wrappers, an infinite loop is possible where a chain
of Wrappers never results in a final InLine VAST response. Another case involves a finite
number of VAST Wrappers in which the resulting InLine response is used as a decisioning
mechanism to find an ad instead of delivering the ad as required. In these cases, the
decisioning mechanism may never return an ad or may take too long to return the ad.
In general, VAST Wrappers should be limited to five before resulting in an InLine response.
If the player detects more than five Wrappers, the player may reject any subsequent
responses in the chain, replace the [ERRORCODE] macro in the VAST/Ad/Wrapper/Error
URI if provided to indicate that the Wrapper limit was reached, and move on to the next
option for an ad. Error codes should be sent for all wrappers in the chain where provided.
When an InLine response fails to produce an ad within the timeframe identified in VPAID or
other ad framework, the player may reject the ad, send error code 304 to indicate that no ad
was produced in the given timeframe, and move on to the next option for an ad. Error codes
should also be sent to any wrappers preceding the InLine response.
##### 2.3.5.2 Wrapper Conflict Management and Precedence

When Companion creative are included directly in the Wrapper response, conflict may
occur. In a VAST ad, whether served with multiple Wrappers or in one Inline response, all
creative offered is intended to be part of the same creative concept, and the media player
should attempt to display all creative presented in the response (or in a chain of responses).
However, when conflict occurs, the media player should favor creative offered closest to the
InLine response.
For example, if a wrapper contains companion creative and the InLine response also
contains companion creative, the companion creative in the Inline response should be
selected (unless both creative can be displayed without conflict).
In another example, if the InLine response is absent of any companion creative but two or
more Wrappers contain companion creative, then creative for the Wrapper served closest to
the InLine response should be favored. However, if multiple creative can be served without
conflict, the media player should attempt to display whatever creative it can.
#### 2.3.6 Error Reporting

The `<Error>` element enables the media player to provide feedback to ad servers when an
Ad cannot be served. In VAST 3.0, detailed error codes and specifications for format are
provided to enable detailed error logging for better ad serving diagnostics.
Providing more detailed error codes enables stronger diagnostics and enables better
technology development over time. If ad servers can collect more detailed information about
why their ads or specific creative couldn’t be served, they can improve their systems to
produce fewer errors.
The `<Error>` element is an optional element nested within the `<InLine>` or `<Wrapper>`
element. It is used to track errors for an Ad. An error for an Inline Ad that is part of a chain
of Wrappers will produce an error for each of the Wrappers used to serve the Inline Ad.
An `<Error>` element is also provided at the root VAST level and is primarily used to report a
“No Ad” response. See section 2.3.5.4 for more information.
##### 2.3.6.1 Ad Server Details: <Error> Element

An `<Error>` element includes a URI that provides a tracking resource for the error. This
error-tracking resource is called when the media player is unable to display the Ad.
The following example is a sample VAST response that includes the `<Error>` element for
an Inline Ad.

```xml
<InLine>
…
<Error>
<![CDATA[http://adserver.com/error.gif]]>
</Error>
…
</InLine>
```

If the ad server wants to collect more specific details about the error from the media player
(as listed in section 2.3.5.3), an [ERRORCODE] macro can be included in the URI.
##### 2.3.6.2 Media Player Details

If an error occurs while trying to load an Ad and the `<Error>` element is provided, the media
player must:
- Request the error source file using the URI provided.
Replace the [ERRORCODE] macro, if provided, with the appropriate error code listed in the
table in section 2.3.5.3. At a minimum, error code 900 (Unidentified error) can be used,
but a more specific error code benefits all parties involved.
If the Ad was served after a chain of Wrapper ad responses, the media player must also
return error details as listed above for each Wrapper response that also includes error
parameters. Macro responses must be correctly percent-encoded per RFC 3986.
The following table lists VAST error codes and their descriptions.
##### 2.3.6.3 VAST Error Codes Table

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 100 | XML parsing error. |
| 101 | VAST schema validation error. |
| 102 | VAST version of response not supported. |
| 200 | Trafficking error. Media player received an Ad type that it was not expecting and/or cannot play. |
| 201 | Media player expecting different linearity. |
| 202 | Media player expecting different duration. |
| 203 | Media player expecting different size. |
| 204 | Ad category was required but not provided. |
| 205 | Inline Category violates Wrapper BlockedAdCategories (refer 3.19.2). |
| 300 | General Wrapper error. |
| 301 | Timeout of VAST URI provided in Wrapper element, or of VAST URI provided in a subsequent Wrapper element. (URI was either unavailable or reached a timeout as defined by the media player.) |
| 302 | Wrapper limit reached, as defined by the media player. Too many Wrapper responses have been received with no InLine response. |
| 303 | No VAST response after one or more Wrappers. |
| 304 | InLine response returned ad unit that failed to result in ad display within defined time limit. |
| 400 | General Linear error. Media player is unable to display the Linear Ad. |
| 401 | File not found. Unable to find Linear/MediaFile from URI. |
| 402 | Timeout of MediaFile URI. |
| 403 | Couldn’t find MediaFile that is supported by this media player, based on the attributes of the MediaFile element. |
| 405 | Problem displaying MediaFile. Media player found a MediaFile with supported type but couldn’t display it. MediaFile may include: unsupported codecs, different MIME type than MediaFile@type, unsupported delivery method, etc. |
| 406 | Mezzanine was required but not provided. Ad not served. |
| 407 | Mezzanine is in the process of being downloaded for the first time. Download may take several hours. Ad will not be served until mezzanine is downloaded and transcoded. |
| 408 | Conditional ad rejected. (deprecated along with conditionalAd) |
| 409 | Interactive unit in the InteractiveCreativeFile node was not executed. |
| 410 | Verification unit in the Verification node was not executed. |
| 411 | Mezzanine was provided as required, but file did not meet required specification. Ad not served. |
| 500 | General NonLinearAds error. |
| 501 | Unable to display NonLinearAd because creative dimensions do not align with creative display area (i.e. creative dimension too large). |
| 502 | Unable to fetch NonLinearAds/NonLinear resource. |
| 503 | Couldn’t find NonLinear resource with supported type. |
| 600 | General CompanionAds error. |
| 601 | Unable to display Companion because creative dimensions do not fit within Companion display area (i.e., no available space). |
| 602 | Unable to display required Companion. |
| 603 | Unable to fetch CompanionAds/Companion resource. |
| 604 | Couldn’t find Companion resource with supported type. |
| 900 | Undefined Error. |
| 901 | General VPAID error. |
##### 2.3.6.4 No Ad Response

When the ad server does not or cannot return an Ad, the VAST response should contain
only the root `<VAST>` element with optional `<Error>` element, as shown below:

```xml
<VAST version="4.1">
<Error>
<![CDATA[http://adserver.com/noad.gif]]>
</Error>
</VAST>
```

The VAST `<Error>` element is optional but if included, the media player must send a
request to the URI provided when the VAST response returns an empty InLine response
after a chain of one or more wrappers. If an [ERRORCODE] macro is included, the media
player should substitute with error code 303.
Besides the VAST level `<Error>` resource file, no other tracking resource requests are
required of the media player in a no-ad response in either the Inline Ad or any Wrappers.
#### 2.3.7 Industry Icon Support

Several initiatives in the advertising industry involve using an icon that overlays on top of an
Ad creative to provide some extended functionality such as to communicate with consumers
or otherwise fulfill requirements of a specific initiative. Often this icon and its functionality
may be provided by a vendor, and is not necessarily served by the ad server or included in
the creative itself.
One example of icon use is for compliance to certain Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-
regulatory principles for interest-based advertising (IBA). This section provides an overview
of how media players can support the use of icons in a general manner while using the
DAA’s AdChoices program, as a specific example.
Icons are optional for audio, and can be used in the context of a companion banner. But
since audio ad players are not required to have a rendering engine, icons are not a
requirement when the adType is “audio” or “hybrid”.
##### 2.3.7.1 Icon Use Case: AdChoices for Interest-Based Advertising (IBA)

The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) sets forth principles that endeavor to give consumers
a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on the
consumer’s online behavior. This control is made available to the consumer in the form of
the AdChoices icon, which is displayed in a prominent location in or around the Ad creative.
When a consumer clicks the icon, they may be offered: information about the ad server and
data providers used to select the Ad, options to learn more about online behavioral
advertising (OBA), and the ability for consumers to opt out from receiving OBA ads in the
future.
##### 2.3.7.2 The <Icons> Element

VAST 3.0 introduced the `<Icons>` element, which is offered under the `<Linear>` creative
element for both Inline and Wrapper ad elements.
The following diagram illustrates the general process for how the `<Icons>` element is
represented in a VAST response.
The Icon Provider Server represented in this diagram may be the same server that serves
the VAST response but more commonly, is a vendor that serves the icon from its own
systems.
When the `<Icons>` element is included in the VAST response, the media player must
display the object as an overlay on top of the Linear Ad with which the icon is served and
after the ad has started (i.e. first frame of video is displayed in the player).
Since a vendor often serves icons and may charge advertising parties for each
Media Player icon served, the media player should not pre-fetch the icon resource until the
Implementation resource can be displayed. Pre-fetching the icon resource may cause the icon
Note provider to falsely record an icon view when the icon may not have been
displayed.
##### 2.3.7.3 Precedence and Conflict Management:

As an Ad goes through a delivery chain, companies may include their own Icon element in
their Wrapper responses. Sometimes these multiple icon elements are all for the same
program and the media player must decide on only one icon to display. When icon elements
represent more than one program, one icon from each program should be displayed.
The media player can use its own business rules to decide which icon to display, along with
any specific program recommendations. For example, when multiple AdChoices icons are
offered, the DAA program recommendation is to select the icon that is closest to the
creative. To comply with the AdChoices program when multiple AdChoices icons are
served, the media player must choose the icon closest to the creative.
If no other rules govern the selection of which icon to display, the media player should
choose the one closest to the creative. That is, if the `<Icon>` element is included within the
Inline Ad, then that icon is the closest to the creative. However, if the Inline Ad contains no

```xml
<Icon> element, but the last Wrapper in a chain of Wrappers did contain the <Icon>
```

element, then the icon from that last Wrapper is the one closest to the creative.
When multiple icons from more than one icon program are included in a chain of wrappers,
the media player must decide which icon from each program should be displayed. Again,
the media player can use its own business rules; however, the icons must not overlap each
other. If all program icons use the same xPosition and yPosition values, the media player
can use width and height attribute values to offset coordinates relative to the display area
of the Ad creative.
Media Player A media player may not be able to display an Icon but should make every attempt to
> Implementation Note do so.
### 2.4 Viewability Verification and Interactive Linear Creative

VAST 4 adds new sections in the Linear file for viewability, ad verification, and interactive
creative files. These new sections offer performance and measurement benefits but also
add a level of complexity.
Player compliance with VAST 4 requires appropriate execution of these files.
The player should execute the ad in the following order:
1. Start loading verification resources
2. Start loading video assets and interactive resources
3. Initialize interactive resources
4. Start ad playback
Player expectations on these added features are summarized here and further defined in
their corresponding sections.
#### 2.4.1 Publisher Viewability

Publishers have the option to offer viewable impression tracking on the ad using the

```xml
<ViewableImpression> feature added in VAST 4. Three URIs may be provided to track
```

whether the ad was `<Viewable>`, `<NotViewable>`, or `<ViewUndetermined>`.
Note that this feature is specific to (the likely uncommon) situation where the publisher is
the party monitoring ad geometry and making the viewability determination. As such, it will
very likely be limited to situations where the buyer and seller have some prior relationship
and agreement around measurement mechanics and the viewability standard used. It is not
a general replacement for, nor should it be confused with, measurement and reporting of
viewability by third-party verification services (as in section 2.4.2). These URIs are not
intended for reporting viewability determinations from such parties.
This feature is not applicable to audio ads.
#### 2.4.2 Viewability with Ad Verification Services

Ad Verification services can be requested for measurement by adding a `<Verification>`
element under `<AdVerifications>` including their executable resources and associated
per-impression metadata. Multiple vendors may use this feature to measure the same ad
session. All verification resources listed in the VAST should be executed, including those
from any intermediary `<Wrapper>` VASTs, barring exceptions based on a whitelist or other
pre-defined rules as outlined below.
A VAST 4 player must check for these elements, however, players may optionally either:
refuse to execute unknown resources or declare it as not supported. The recommended
process is to consult an IAB TechLab-provided/certified list of known verification vendors
and domains, although the exact mechanism is left to the publisher/player. The player must
request each associated verificationNotExecuted tracking event URI (with the [REASON]
macro filled with reason code 1) in the case that it refuses to execute one or more
verification script (see section 3.17.4 for details).
Verification resources should be executed as required by the OMID specification. If the
code cannot be executed as provided, any included verificationNotExecuted tracking events
URIs must be sent with the appropriate reason code (e.g. not supported, error, etc.).
#### 2.4.3 Interactive Linear Creative Files

In VAST 4, the `<MediaFile>` should only be used to include video or audio files. For Linear
files that require an API framework to be executed, the new `<InteractiveCreativeFile>`
should be used to include these files. Once the `<AdVerifications>` element has been
checked for verification code, the `<InteractiveCreativeFile>` element should be checked
for code in order to execute the ad. When the `<InteractiveCreativeFile>` cannot be
executed, the `<Error>` should be sent and the player may check the `<MediaFiles>` element
for any media files that are available to be played.
This script asset should only be used to enable interactive, dynamic or other creative
capabilities and not used for viewability, client-side arbitration, or other non-creative uses.
## 3 VAST Implementation

VAST is an XML schema for providing metadata about an ad for in-stream video or audio
that is parsed by a player or by a server on the player's behalf. This section provides the
details for forming the VAST.
Beginning with section 3.1, each element available in VAST is described and a table
summarizes information about hierarchy, requirements, and attributes. Each VAST element
that includes nested elements is defined under a second-level heading in this document.
Third-level headings represent nested elements that have no additional nested elements
under them.
Links to the table of contents (TOC) and the schema are provided under each heading to
aid in navigation. The human-readable schema in section summarizes VAST elements and
provides a link to the chapter that describes the element in more detail.
Before forming a VAST document, considerations for the XML namespace and browser
security for JavaScript or other scripting languages should be established as follows.
XML Namespace
Whenever VAST is used in conjunction with any other XML template, such as with VMAP or
VAST extensions, a namespace should be declared for each so that the elements of one
are not confused with the elements of another.
For more information, visit: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/
Browser Security
Modern browsers restrict Adobe Flash and JavaScript runtime environments from retrieving
data from other servers. Since typical VAST responses come from other servers, measures
must be taken for each.
Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for JavaScript
In order for JavaScript media players to accept a VAST response, ad servers must include
a CORS header in the http file that wraps the VAST response. The CORS header must be
formatted as follows:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin header value>
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
These HTTP headers allow an ads player on any origin to read the VAST response from the
ad server origin. The value of Access-Control-Allow-Origin should be the value of the
Origin header sent with the ad request.
Setting the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header to true will ensure that cookies
will be sent and received properly.
Note: For requests where the Origin header is null, ad servers should respond with only

### 3.1 Declaring the VAST Response

All VAST responses share the same general structure. Each VAST response is declared
with `<VAST>` as its topmost element along with the version attribute indicating the official
version with which the response is compliant. For example, a VAST 4.1 response is
declared as follows:

```xml
<VAST version="4.1">
```

As with all XML documents, each element must be closed after details nested within the
element are provided. The following example is a VAST response with one nested `<Ad>`
element.

```xml
<VAST version="4.1">
<Ad>
<!--ad details go here-->
</Ad>
</VAST>
```

### 3.2 VAST

VAST is the root node for a VAST-compliant ad response and is used to declare the VAST
response as described in section 3.1.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Yes**
Response
Parent None (root)
Bounded 1
Sub-elements Error*
Ad*
Attributes Description
version A float number (number with decimal) to indicate the VAST version being used.
*either `<Error>` or `<Ad>` may be provided but not both
#### 3.2.1 Error (VAST)

Used to report a no-ad response. When the ad server does not or cannot return an Ad, the
VAST response should contain only the root `<VAST>` element with one or more `<Error>`
elements, as shown below:

```xml
<VAST version="4.1">
<Error>
<![CDATA[http://adserver.com/noad.gif]]>
</Error>
</VAST>
```

The VAST `<Error>` element is optional but if included, the media player must use the URI
provided to notify the server that no ad was returned. Multiple `<Error>` elements may be
provided to notify multiple parties of the no-ad response.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response No, but if supplied no other elements are allowed**
Parent VAST
Bounded 0+
Contents A URI supplied by the ad server and used to report the no ad response
### 3.3 Ad

The `<Ad>` element may contain an `<InLine>` ad or a `<Wrapper>`. The wrapper points to a
secondary server for another VAST response, which may be another wrapper or an InLine
response. An InLine response contains the ad creative necessary to execute ad playback.
#### 3.3.1 Ad Pods and Stand-Alone Ads

While a single `<Ad>` element represents the most common VAST response, multiple ads
may be included as either stand-alone ads or a Pod of ads, or a mix of both. Ads in a Pod
are distinguished by using the sequence attribute for an `<Ad>`, denoting which ad plays first,
second, and so on. If the player supports Ad Pods, sequenced ads are played in numerical
order and all ads in the Pod should be played to the best of the player's ability. All sequence
values in a VAST response must be unique.
Non-sequenced ads, are stand-alone ads and considered part of an "ad buffet" from which
the player may select one or more ad to play in any order. Stand-alone ads may be included
in a VAST response with an Ad Pod and may be used to substitute an ad in the Pod when
an ad cannot be played.
The following diagram illustrates some options for how the `<Ad>` element may be
represented in a VAST response.
If the media player cannot display an entire Ad Pod or any stand-alone ads, it can decline
from loading the ad resources and use the error URI, if provided, to notify the server.
Playing a Pod of Ads
When electing to play a Pod of ads returned by the ad server, the media player must play
the ads in the Pod in the prescribed sequence and should play as many of the ads as
possible. The player may elect to truncate any ads at the end of an Ad Pod if either: the ads
cannot be played because they cannot physically fit into the ad break in the stream (such as
when time is limited in a live stream) or if the Pod violated any limits specified by the media
player request (for example: number of ads to return, or maximum pod duration).
When an Ad Pod is the result of following a VAST `<Wrapper>` the same impression and
tracking URIs in the VAST `<Wrapper>` are called as each ad in the Pod is played.
Should an ad in the Pod fail to play, the media player should substitute an un-played stand-
alone ad from the response. If stand-alone ads are unavailable, the player should move on
to the next ad in the Ad Pod.
If a Wrapper is used to provide an ad in the Ad Pod, the Wrapper can use attributes,
allowMultipleAds=false and followAdditionalWrappers=false to prevent performance
issues that result from an unmanaged string of Wrappers and multiple ads in an Ad Pod.
If multiple `<Ad>` elements are provided with sequence attributes and the player
supports Ad Pods, all ads in the Pod must be played to the best of the player's ability. If
not supported or the Pod cannot be played, the media player should use the error-
Media Player
> Implementation Note tracking URI, if provided, to notify the server.
A special exemption exists when using VMAP. Please visit http://iab.com/vmap for
information on VMAP.
#### 3.3.2 The Ad Element

Properties for the `<Ad>` element are listed in the following table.
**Player Support Required (Ad Pod support is optional)**
**Required in Yes (unless there is no ad to return; in which case `<Error>` should be used to provide**
Response an error URI)
Parent VAST
Bounded 0+ (In a no ad response, `<Ad>` is not allowed, but in all other cases at least one `<Ad>` is
required.)
Sub-elements InLine*
Wrapper*
Attributes Description
id An ad server-defined identifier string for the ad
sequence A number greater than zero (0) that identifies the sequence in which an ad should play;
all `<Ad>` elements with sequence values are part of a pod and are intended to be played
in sequence
conditionalAd [Deprecated in VAST 4.1, along with apiFramework]
A Boolean value that identifies a conditional ad. In the case of programmatic ad
serving, a VPAID ad unit or other mechanism might be used to decide whether there
is an ad that matches the placement. When there is no match, an ad may not be
served. Use of the conditionalAd attribute enables publishers to avoid accepting
these ads in placements where an ad must be served. A value of true indicates that
the ad is conditional and should be used in all cases where the InLine executable unit
(such as VPAID) is not an ad but is instead a framework for finding an ad; a value of
false is the default value and indicates that an ad is available.
adType
An optional string that identifies the type of ad. This allows VAST to support audio ad
scenarios.
Possible values – video, audio, hybrid.
Default value – video (assumed to be video if attribute is not present)
More details on the use case in section 1.5
*one `<InLine>` or `<Wrapper>` element is required but both are not allowed
### 3.4 InLine

Within the nested elements of an `<InLine>` ad are all the files and URIs necessary to play
and track the ad. In a chain of `<Wrapper>` VAST responses, an `<InLine>` response ends the
chain.

description is needed, the `<Description>` element can be used.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Yes**
Response
Parent InLine
Bounded 1
Content A string that provides a common name for the ad
#### 3.4.3 AdServingId

Any ad server that returns a VAST containing an `<InLine>` ad must generate a pseudo-
unique identifier that is appropriate for all involved parties to track the lifecycle of that ad.
This should be inserted into the `<AdServingId>` element, and also be included on all
outgoing tracking pixels. The purpose of this id is to greatly reduce the amount of work
required to compare impression-level data across multiple systems, which is otherwise
done by passing proprietary IDs across different systems and matching them.
This value should be different for each `<InLine>` in a VAST (i.e. each `<Ad>` in an Ad Pod or
buffet should have distinct `<AdServingId>` values). The player is responsible for parsing this
value and using it to fill the associated macro (see section 6) on tracking pixels.
Using a GUID for the AdServingId value is recommended. Other formats are acceptable,
provided they are generally sufficiently unique to allow different systems to match tracking
data. Ad servers may also choose to prepend their AdSystem or a shortened version of
their server name to ID value, so that the originating server can easily be identified from the
ID alone.
Example: ServerName-47ed3bac-1768-4b9a-9d0e-0b92422ab066
Note that only `<InLine>` elements may provide an `<AdServingId>`. Servers providing

```xml
<Wrapper> VASTs may learn the ad serving ID by including the [ADSERVINGID] macro in
```

their tracking pixels.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Yes (for InLine)**
Response
Parent InLine

Content A unique or pseudo-unique (long enough to be unique when combined with timestamp
data) numerical value.
#### 3.4.4 Impression

The ad server provides an impression-tracking URI for either the InLine ad or the Wrapper
using the `<Impression>` element. All `<Impression>` URIs in the InLine response and any
Wrapper responses preceding it should be triggered at the same time when the impression
for the ad occurs, or as close in time as possible to when the impression occurs, to prevent
impression-counting discrepancies.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Yes**
Response
Parent InLine or Wrapper
Bounded 1+
Content A URI that directs the media player to a tracking resource file that the media player must
use to notify the ad server when the impression occurs. If there is no reason to include
an Impression element, the placeholder "about:blank" should be used instead of a
tracking URL. The player should disregard dispatching the tracking URI if it is set to
"about:blank"..
Attributes Description
id An ad server id for the impression. Impression URIs of the same id for an ad should be
requested at the same time or as close in time as possible to help prevent discrepancies.
#### 3.4.5 Category

Used in creative separation and for compliance in certain programs, a category field is
needed to categorize the ad’s content. Several category lists exist, some for describing site
content and some for describing ad content. Some lists are used interchangeably for both
site content and ad content. For example, the category list used to comply with the IAB
Quality Assurance Guidelines (QAG) describes site content, but is sometimes used to
describe ad content.
The VAST category field should only use AD CONTENT description categories.
The authority attribute is used to identify the organizational authority that developed the
list being used. In some cases, the publisher may require that an ad category be identified.
If required by the publisher and not provided, the publisher may skip the ad, notify the ad
server using the `<Error>` URI, if provided (error code 204), and move on to the next option.
If category is used, the authority= attribute must be provided.
**Player Support Optional**
**Required in Response No***
Parent InLine
Bounded 0+
Content A string that provides a category code or label that identifies the ad content
category.
Attributes Description
authority * A URL for the organizational authority that produced the list being used to identify
ad content category.
*Optional unless the publisher requires ad categories. The authority attribute is required if categories
are provided.
Example:

```xml
<Category authority=”iabtechlab.com”>232</Category>
```

(where the IAB Ad Product Taxonomy is being used, and 232 is the category and maps to a particular
category - say Automobiles or Designer Clothing)
#### 3.4.6 Description

When a longer description of the ad is needed, the `<Description>` element can be used.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response No**
Parent InLine
Bounded 0-1
Content A string value that describes a longer description of the ad
#### 3.4.7 Advertiser

Providing an advertiser name can help publishers prevent display of the ad with its
competitors. Ad serving parties and publishers should identify how to interpret values
provided within this element.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response No**
Parent InLine
Bounded 0-1
Content A string that provides the name of the advertiser as defined by the ad serving
party. Recommend using the domain of the advertiser.
Attributes Description
id An (optional) identifier for the advertiser, provided by the ad server. Can be used
for internal analytics.
#### 3.4.8 Pricing

Used to provide a value that represents a price that can be used by real-time bidding (RTB)
systems. VAST is not designed to handle RTB since other methods exist, but this element
is offered for custom solutions if needed. If the value provided is to be obfuscated or
encoded, publishers and advertisers must negotiate the appropriate mechanism to do so.
When included as part of a VAST Wrapper in a chain of Wrappers, only the value offered in
the first Wrapper need be considered.
**Player Support Recommended**
**Required in Response No**
Parent InLine or Wrapper
Bounded 0-1
Content A numerical value that represents a price that can be used in real-time bidding

currency* The three-letter ISO-4217 currency symbol that identifies the currency of the value
provided (e.g. USD, GBP, etc.).
*required
#### 3.4.9 Survey

The survey node is deprecated in VAST 4.1, since usage was very limited and survey
implementations can be supported by other VAST elements such as 3rd party trackers.
Ad tech vendors may want to use the ad to collect data for resource purposes. The

```xml
<Survey> element can be used to provide a URI to any resource file having to do with
```

collecting survey data. Publishers and any parties using the `<Survey>` element should
determine how surveys are implemented and executed. Multiple survey elements may be
provided.
A type attribute is available to specify the MIME type being served. For example, the
attribute might be set to type="text/javascript". Surveys can be dynamically inserted
into the VAST response as long as cross-domain issues are avoided.
**Player Support Recommended**
**Required in Response No**
Parent InLine
Bounded 0+
Content A URI to any resource relating to an integrated survey.
Attributes Description
type The MIME type of the resource being served.
#### 3.4.10 Expires

The number of seconds in which the ad is valid for execution. In cases where the ad is
requested ahead of time, this timing indicates how many seconds after the request that the
ad expires and cannot be played. This element is useful for preventing an ad from playing
after a timeout has occurred.
If no value is provided, the response can be played back at any time indefinitely after being
received by the player.
**Player Support Recommended**
**Required in Response No**
Parent InLine
Bounded 0-1
Content An integer value that defines the expiry period (in seconds).
#### 3.4.11 Error (InLine and Wrapper)

The `<Error>` element contains a URI that the player uses to notify the ad server when
errors occur with ad playback. If the URI contains an [ERRORCODE] macro, the media player
must populate the macro with an error code as defined in section 2.3.6.
If no specific error can be found, error 900 may be used to indicate an undefined error;
however, every attempt should be made to provide an error code that maps to the error that
occurred. The `<Error>` element is available for both the InLine or Wrapper elements.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response No**
Parent InLine or Wrapper
Bounded 0+
Content A URI to a tracking resource to be used when an error in ad playback occurs.
### 3.5 ViewableImpression

The ad server may provide URIs for tracking publisher-determined viewability, for both the
InLine ad and any Wrappers, using the `<ViewableImpression>` element. Tracking URIs
may be provided in three containers: `<Viewable>`, `<NotViewable>`, and

```xml
<ViewUndetermined>.
```

The point at which these tracking resource files are pinged depends on the viewability
standard the player has implemented, in agreement with or with the understanding of the
buyer.
Player support for the `<ViewableImpression>` element is optional. When used, URIs for the
Inline ad as well as any wrappers used to serve the ad should all be triggered at the same
time, or as close in time as possible to when the criteria for the individual event is met.
Note – ViewableImpression is not applicable for Audio use cases.

### 3.6 Creatives

The `<Creatives>` (plural) element is a container for one or more `<Creative>` (singular)
element used to provide creative files for the ad. For an InLine ad, the `<Creatives>` element
nests all the files necessary for executing and tracking the ad.
In a Wrapper, elements nested under `<Creatives>` are used mostly for tracking.
Companion and Icon creative may be included in a Wrapper, but files for Linear and
NonLinear ads can only be provided in the InLine version of the ad.

Attributes Description
id A string used to identify the ad server that provides the creative.
adId Used to provide the ad server’s unique identifier for the creative. In VAST 4, the
UniversalAdId element was introduced to provide a unique identifier for the creative
that is maintained across systems. Please see section 3.7.1 for details on the
UniversalAdId.
sequence A number representing the numerical order in which each sequenced creative within
an ad should play.
apiFramework A string that identifies an API that is needed to execute the creative.
*required
The Creative sequence attribute should not be confused with the Ad sequence
General attribute. Creative sequence identifies the sequence of multiple creative within a
> Implementation Note single ad and does NOT define a Pod. Conversely, the Ad sequence identifies the
sequence of multiple ads and defines an Ad Pod. See section 3.3.1 for details
about Ad Pods.
#### 3.7.1 UniversalAdId

A required element for the purpose of tracking ad creative, the `<UniversalAdId>` is used to
provide a unique creative identifier that is maintained across systems. This creative ID may
be generated with an authoritative program, such as the AD-ID® program in the United
States, or ClearCast in the UK, or by any company’s creative ID registration system. Some
countries may have specific requirements for ad-tracking programs.
The UniversalAdId element is required in 4, but the attribute value for idRegistry and the
idValue in the node are to be used to support a company’s need for tracking ad creative. If
no common registry is used, a value of "unknown" may be used. Ad servers and publishers
should discuss what is required for this field to support a successful ad campaign.
Note: A creative id can also be included in the adId attribute used in the `<Creative>`
element, but that creative id should be used to specify the ad server’s unique identifier. The
UniversalAdId is used for maintaining a creative id for the ad across multiple systems.
Note – VAST 4.0 had an attribute “idValue” that was a duplicate of the node value and so
was removed as of 4.1. Media players should not fail if this attribute is present, but should
always use the Content as the source of truth for the creative ID value.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response Yes**
Parent Creative only in the InLine format
Bounded 1
Content A string identifying the unique creative identifier. Default value is “unknown”
Attributes Description

<UniversalAdId idRegistry="ad-id.org">CNPA0484000H<UniversalAdId>
<UniversalAdId idRegistry="clearcast.co.uk"> AAA/BBBB123/030<UniversalAdId>
```

#### 3.7.2 CreativeExtensions

When an executable file is needed as part of the creative delivery or execution, a

```xml
<CreativeExtensions> element can be added under the <Creative>. This extension can
```

be used to load an executable creative with or without using the `<MediaFile>`.
A `<CreativeExtension>` (singular) element is nested under the `<CreativeExtensions>`
(plural) element so that any XML extensions are separated from VAST XML. Additionally,
any XML used in this extension should identify an XML name space (xmlns) to avoid
confusing any of the extension element names with those of VAST.
The nested `<CreativeExtension>` includes an attribute for type, which specifies the MIME
type needed to execute the extension.
**Player Support Recommended**

### 3.8 Linear

Linear Ads are the video or audio formatted ads that play linearly within the streaming
content, meaning before the streaming content, during a break, or after the streaming
content. A Linear creative contains a `<Duration>` element to communicate the intended
runtime and a `<MediaFiles>` element used to provide the needed video or audio files for ad
execution.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response Yes**
Parent Creative for both InLine and Wrapper formats
Bounded 0-1
Sub-elements Duration*

publisher may define a minimum skipoffset value in its policies and disregard
Skippable creative when skipoffset values are lower than publisher's
minimum.
*required
#### 3.8.1 Duration

The ad server uses the `<Duration>` element to denote the intended playback duration for
the video or audio component of the ad. Time value may be in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm
where .mmm indicates milliseconds. Providing milliseconds is optional.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response Yes**
Parent Linear only in the InLine format
Bounded 1
Content A time value for the duration of the Linear ad in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm
(.mmm is optional and indicates milliseconds).
#### 3.8.2 AdParameters

Some ad serving systems may want to send data to the media file when first initialized. For
example, the media file may use ad server data to identify the context used to display the
creative, what server to talk to, or even which creative to display. The optional

```xml
<AdParameters> element for the Linear creative enables this data exchange.
```

The optional attribute xmlEncoded is available for the `<AdParameters>` element to identify
whether the ad parameters are xml-encoded. If true, the media player can only decode the
data using XML. Media players operating on earlier versions of VAST may not be able to
XML-decode data, so data should only be xml-encoded when being served to media
players capable of XML-decoding the data.
When a VAST response is used to serve a VPAID ad unit, the `<AdParameters>` element is
currently the only way to pass information from the VAST response into the VPAID object;
no other mechanism is provided.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response No**
Parent Linear only in the InLine format
Companion for both InLine and Wrapper formats
Bounded 0-1
Content Metadata for the ad.
Attributes Description
xmlEncoded Identifies whether the ad parameters are xml-encoded.
### 3.9 MediaFiles

Since the first version of VAST, the MediaFiles element was designated for linear video
files. Over the years as digital video technology advances, the media files placed in a VAST
tag have come to include complex files that require interactive API integration. Players not
equipped with the technology to execute such files may be unable to play the ad or execute
interactive components. In VAST 4, the linear video files should be separate from the
interactive components that require API integration. Separating these files enable the ad to
play in more players and improves ad play performance.
It is worth noting that when multiple MediaFile nodes are present, the publisher should
decide which file to play based on attributes of the MediaFile nodes and not the structure of
the document (e.g. defaulting to the first MediaFile included in the document).
Linear media files should be submitted as follows:
Video/Audio file only: Include three `<MediaFile>` elements (section 3.9.1), each
with a URI to a ready-to-serve video or audio file at quality levels for high, medium,
and low. Please review the IAB Digital Video Ad Format Guidelines for guidance on
ready-to-serve file quality specifications.
Video/Audio file for use in ad-stitching: In addition to the three ready-to-serve
files, use the `<Mezzanine>` element (section 3.9.2) to include a URI to the raw video
or audio file. Please review the IAB Digital Video Ad Format Guidelines for guidance
on mezzanine file specifications.
Interactive linear video file: In addition to at least one ready-to-serve video/audio
file included in the `<MediaFile>` element, use the `<InteractiveCreativeFile>`
element (section 3.9.3) to include a URI to the interactive media file, specifying the
API framework required to execute the file. When interactive files are included in the
VAST response, they should be executed before any video files are executed.
The components of the `<MediaFiles>` elements:
**Player Support Required if `<Linear>` is supported**
**Required in Response Yes (Linear ads)**
Parent Linear only for InLine format
Bounded 1 (When `<Linear>` is used)
Sub-elements MediaFile*
Mezzanine**
InteractiveCreativeFile
ClosedCaptionFiles
*required **required in ad-stitched video executions
#### 3.9.1 MediaFile

In VAST 4.x `<MediaFile>` should only be used to contain the video or audio file for a Linear
ad. In particular, three ready-to-serve files should be included, each of a quality level for
high, medium, or low. A ready-to-serve video/audio file is a media that is transcoded to a
level of quality that can be transferred over an internet connection within a reasonable time
for viewing. Each ready-to-serve file must be of the same MIME type and, if different MIME
types files are made available for the ad, three ready-to-serve files should represent each
MIME type separately.
When an interactive API is needed to deliver and execute the Linear Ad, the URI to the
interactive file should be included in the `<InteractiveCreativeFile>`. In addition, at least
one ready-to-serve video ad should be available in `<MediaFile>` so that the video ad can be
played by the video player.
Guidelines for ad files that fulfill quality levels of high, medium, or low can be found in the
IAB Digital Video Ad Format Guidelines. An adaptive bitrate streaming file featuring files at
the three quality levels may also be provided.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response Yes**

height* The native height of the video file, in pixels. (0 for audio ads)
codec The codec used to encode the file which can take values as specified by RFC
4281: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4281.
id An identifier for the media file.
bitrate or minBitrate For progressive load video or audio, the bitrate value specifies the average
and maxBitrate bitrate for the media file; otherwise the minBitrate and maxBitrate can be
used together to specify the minimum and maximum bitrates for streaming
videos or audio files.
scalable a Boolean value that indicates whether the media file is meant to scale to larger
dimensions.
maintainAspectRatio a Boolean value that indicates whether aspect ratio for media file dimensions
should be maintained when scaled to new dimensions.
apiFramework** [Deprecated in 4.1 in preparation for VPAID being phased out]
identifies the API needed to execute an interactive media file, but current
support is for backward compatibility. Please use the

```xml
<InteractiveCreativeFile> element to include files that require an API
```

for execution.

and duration.
Units - Bytes
mediaType Type of media file (2D / 3D / 360 / etc).
Optional.
Default value = 2D
*required
**if an API framework is needed to execute the ad, please use

```xml
<InteractiveCreativeFile> to provide API files.
```

*** required if video/hybrid adType (not required if audio)
#### 3.9.2 Mezzanine

The media player may use a raw mezzanine file to transcode video or audio files at quality
levels specific to the needs of certain environments. An XSD will validate this element as
optional, but a mezzanine file is required in ad-stitched executions and whenever a
publisher requires it. If no mezzanine file is available, this element may be excluded;
however, publishers that require it may ignore the VAST response when not provided. If an
ad is rejected for this reason, error code 406 is available to communicate the error when an

```xml
<Error> URI and macro are provided.
```

The mezzanine file is used to transcode a file that can play in the systems they
support and should never be used for direct ad playback.
The mezzanine file specifications are defined in the Digital Video Ad Format Guidelines.
**Player Support Optional**
**Required in Response No***
Parent MediaFiles only in InLine format.
Bounded 0+
Content A CDATA-wrapped URI to a raw, high-quality media file.
Attributes Description
delivery* Either “progressive” for progressive download protocols (such as HTTP) or
“streaming” for streaming protocols.
type* MIME type for the file container. Popular MIME types include, but are not limited to
“video/mp4” for MP4, “audio/mpeg” and "audio/aac" for audio ads.
width* The native width of the video file, in pixels.
height* The native height of the video file, in pixels.
codec The codec used to encode the file which can take values as specified by RFC 4281:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4281.
id An identifier for the media file.
fileSize Optional field that helps eliminate the need to calculate the size based on bitrate
and duration.
mediaType Type of media file (3D / 360 / etc).
Optional.
Default value = 2D
* VAST tags served to ad-stitching servers require a mezzanine file and may reject the
VAST response if no mezzanine file is provided.
#### 3.9.3 InteractiveCreativeFile

For any media file that uses interactive APIs for advanced creative functionality, the

```xml
<InteractiveCreativeFile> element is used to identify the file and the framework needed
```

for execution.
Providing the interactive portion for a media file in a section of VAST separate from the
video/audio file enables players to more easily play the video/audio file when no support is
available to execute the API, especially for players that work with an ad-stitching service or
make ad calls from a server on behalf of the player.
The player should attempt to execute the interactive file before attempting to load any

```xml
<MediaFile>, but if the file cannot be executed, the player should trigger any included error
```

URIs and use error code 409 when macros are provided.
Note re Audio Ads: While not in use today, this could be used for pure audio interactivity outside of a
click on devices like Alexa.

variableDuration Boolean.
Useful for interactive use cases. Identifies whether the ad always drops when the
duration is reached, or if it can potentially extend the duration by pausing the
underlying video or delaying the adStopped call after adVideoComplete. If it set to
true the extension of the duration should be user-initiated (typically by engaging
with an interactive element to view additional content).
#### 3.9.4 ClosedCaptionFiles

Optional node that enables closed caption sidecar files associated with the ad media (video or
audio) to be provided to the player. Multiple files with different mime-types may be provided as
children of this node to allow the player to select the one it is compatible with.
Note: It is expected that all the media files tied to parent MediaFiles node are associated with
the same original creative and therefore of the same media length as well as accurately
synchronized with closed captioned media segments times, so all the files under
ClosedCaptionFiles should work for all the MediaFile nodes.

### 3.10 VideoClicks

The `<VideoClicks>` element provides URIs for clickthroughs, clicktracking, and custom
clicks and is available for Linear Ads in both the InLine and Wrapper formats. Both InLine
and Wrapper formats offer the ClickTracking and CustomClick elements, but only the InLine
Linear Ad offers the ClickThrough element. These elements are defined in the following
sections.

#### 3.10.3 CustomClick

The `<CustomClick>` is used to track any interactions with the linear ad that do not include
the clickthrough click and do not take the viewer away from the media player. For example,
if an ad vendor wants to track that a viewer clicked a button to change the ad's background
color, the `<CustomClick>` element holds the URI to notify the ad vendor that this click
happened. An API may be needed to inform the player that a click occurred and that the
corresponding URI should be activated.

### 3.11 Icons

The industry icon feature was defined in VAST 3.0 to support initiatives such as privacy
programs. An example of such a program is the AdChoices program for interest-based
advertising (IBA). Though the VAST icon feature was initially created to support privacy
programs, it was designed to support other programs that require posting an icon with the
linear ad.
This feature is only offered for Linear Ads because icons can be easily inserted in
NonLinear ads and companion creative using existing features. Icon source files may also
be included in a wrapper if necessary.
The structure for Linear icons uses the `<Icons>` element (plural) as a container for one or
more `<Icon>` elements (singular). Each `<Icon>` element provides containers for the creative
resource file in section 3.15. Icon tracking is described in sections 3.11.2 to 3.11.5.
See section 2.3.7 for details about industry icon support in VAST.

### 3.12 NonLinearAds

NonLinear ads are the overlay ads that display as an image or rich media on top of video
content during playback. Within an InLine ad, at least one of `<Linear>` or `<NonLinearAds>`
needs to be provided within the `<Creative>` element.
NonLinearAds are not applicable to Audio use cases.
The `<NonLinearAds>` element is a container for the `<NonLinear>` creative files and tracking
resources. If used in a wrapper, only the tracking elements are available. NonLinear
creative cannot be provided in a wrapper ad. NonLinear ad creative use non-video creative
files that are describe in section 3.15. Tracking event elements are described in section 3.14.
Ad parameters are used to provide contextual information to the ad and are described in
section 3.8.2.

apiFramework The API necessary to communicate with the creative if available.
minSuggestedDuratio the minimum suggested duration that the creative should be displayed;
n duration is in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm (where .mmm is in milliseconds and is
optional)
#### 3.12.2 NonLinearClickThrough

Most NonLinear creative can provide a clickthrough of their own, but in the case where the
creative cannot provide a clickthrough, such as with a simple static image, the

```xml
<NonLinearClickThrough> element can be used to provide the clickthrough.
```

A clickthrough may need to be provided for an InLine ad in the following situations:
- Static image file
- Any static resource file where the media player handles the click, such as when
“playerHandles=true” in a VPAID AdClickThru event.
NonLinearClickThrough is only available for InLine ads.
**Player Support Required if `<NonLinearAds>` is supported**

#### 3.12.3 NonLinearClickTracking

When the NonLinear ad creative handles the clickthrough in an InLine ad, the

```xml
<NonLinearClickTracking> element is used to track the click, provided the ad has a way to
```

notify the player that that ad was clicked, such as when using a VPAID ad unit. The
NonLinearClickTracking element is also used to track clicks in Wrappers.
NonLinearClickTracking might be used for an InLine ad when:
- Any static resource file where the media player handles the click, such as when
“playerHandles=true” in a VPAID AdClickThru event.
NonLinearClickTracking is used in a Wrapper Ad in the following situations:
- Static image file
- Flash file with no API framework (deprecated)
- Flash file in which apiFramework=clickTAG (deprecated)
- Any static resource file where the media player handles the click, such as when
“playerHandles=true” in a VPAID AdClickThru event

### 3.13 CompanionAds

Companion Ads are secondary ads included in the VAST tag that accompany the
video/audio ad. The `<CompanionAds>` element is a container for one or more `<Companion>`
elements, where each Companion element provides the creative files and tracking details.
Companion Ads, including any creative, may be included in both InLine and Wrapper
formatted VAST ads.
The required attribute for the `<CompanionAds>` element provides information about which
Companion creative to display when multiple Companions are supplied and whether the ad
can be displayed without its Companion creative. The value for required can be one of
three values: all, any, or none.
The expected behavior for displaying Companion ads depends on the following values:
- all: the media player must attempt to display the contents for all `<Companion>`
elements provided. If all companion creative cannot be displayed, the ad should be
disregarded and the ad server should be notified using the `<Error>` element.
- any: the media player must attempt to display content from at least one of the

```xml
<Companion> elements provided (i.e. display the one with dimensions that best fit the
```

page). If none of the companion creative can be displayed, the ad should be
disregarded and the ad server should be notified using the `<Error>` element.
- none: the media player may choose to not display any of the companion creative,
but is not restricted from doing so. The ad server may use this option when the
advertiser prefers that the master Linear or NonLinear ad be displayed even if the
companion cannot be displayed.
If not provided, the media player can choose to display content from any or none of the

```xml
<Companion> elements.
```

VAST 4.1 includes a new attribute for companions: renderingMode.
Previous versions of VAST did not allow for the ad server to specify how and when
companions would be shown. An asset and width/height information were included, and the
assumption was that the companion would be shown alongside the video as a banner. This
usage of companions has dropped out of favor over time, while a new usage of the
companion as an asset to be displayed full-screen after the video has gained favor in
mobile in-app inventory. The renderingMode attribute accommodates the newer end-card
use case as part of VAST while laying the groundwork for additional uses of the companion.
The renderingMode attribute accepts a few values. The publisher player/SDK has control of
which of these renderingMode values are supported and this should be communicated as
part of the publisher ad format specs.
Companion as End-Card
A value of "end-card" signals to the player that this companion ad is meant to be shown
after the video stops playing. The end-card should match the dimensions of the preceding
video. If the companion width and height are not zero, the player may use these values to
infer the aspect ratio of the companion ad.
Companion duration is a new consideration for the end-card and assumed to be controlled
by the publisher player/SDK and communicated as part of the publisher ad format specs.
Known variations in market include an “infinite” duration, which requires the viewer to close
the end-card after it is shown, and a timed duration. For any companion that suspends
content playback, such as an in-stream ad, and does not include a time-out, the player/SDK
must implement a close control to prevent users from being trapped in the ad. For out-
stream ads that do not interfere with content, the close control is not mandatory.
It is also up to the publisher whether a skippable video should show an associated end-card
when the video is skipped. Most implementations by major mobile SDKs currently do so.
Click-throughs triggered from the companion should make sure to open in a new browser
window rather than replacing the existing end card or another window needed by the app.
This ensures that the consumer can exit the webpage that’s loaded upon clicking through
the ad and to make sure that the app experience isn’t disrupted.
The VAST event of closeLinear must be fired upon the companion closing. This allows for
ads that use companions to know when the companion was dismissed.
Companies providing the end card creative should adhere to IAB Tech Lab LEAN
guidelines.
Companion as Concurrent Display Ad
A value of "concurrent" signals to the player that this companion ad is meant to be shown
alongside the video for the duration of the video playback. This reflects the original use of
the companion in desktop inventory.
Additional Creative Uses of the Companion Ad
The companion ad may be used for new implementations, and as such new values of the
renderingMode attribute may be used if supported by the publisher and the ad server. The
renderingMode may use other values other than the ones listed to support these additional
use cases.
For example, proprietary formats that show content alongside a video could be supported
by the standard with a “split-screen” renderingMode, displaying a 1:1 aspect ratio video,
alongside an equal sized companion in both portrait and landscape mode.
The goal is that renderingMode will provide some initial standards support for format
innovation in environments that cannot, or will not, support VPAID with future spec changes
to follow market developments.
Default or Empty renderingMode
The renderingMode attribute may be omitted. In this case, the player will assume that the
renderingMode value is set as “default” and will handle the companion in whatever way it
does by default.
Non-Creative Use of the Companion Ad
The companion is intended to be used as an additional creative element. Inclusion of a
companion to support non-creative functionality (e.g. additional tracking) is considered to be
contrary to the intention of the spec.

CompanionClickThrough element can be used to provide the clickthrough.
A clickthrough may need to be provided for an InLine ad in the following situations:
- Static image file
- Any static resource file where the media player handles the click, such as when
“playerHandles=true” in a VPAID AdClickThru event.

CompanionClickTracking element is used to track the click, provided the ad has a way to
notify the player that that ad was clicked, such as when using a VPAID ad unit. The
CompanionClickTracking element is also used in Wrappers to track clicks that occur for the
Companion creative in the InLine ad that is returned after one or more wrappers.
CompanionClickTracking might be used for an InLine ad when:
- Any static resource file where the media player handles the click, such as when
“playerHandles=true” in a VPAID AdClickThru event
CompanionClickTracking is used in a Wrapper in the following situations:
- Static image file. Any static resource file where the media player handles the click,
such as when “playerHandlesClick=true” in VPAID
- Any static resource file where the media player handles the click, such as when
“playerHandlesClick=true” in VPAID

### 3.14 Tracking Event Elements

The `<TrackingEvents>` element is a container for `<Tracking>` elements used to define
specific tracking events described in section 3.14.1. Multiple tracking events can be used to
help all the relevant parties track the ad’s performance. Each tracking event URI should be
included one `<Tracking>` element, using the event attribute to identify which event is to be
tracked.
The following example shows the section of a VAST response that represents 3 tracking
events: two start events, each for a different server, and a complete event.

```xml
<TrackingEvents>
<Tracking event="start">
<![CDATA[http://server1.com/start.jpg]]>
</Tracking>
<Tracking event="start">
<![CDATA[http://server2.com/start2.jpg]]>
</Tracking>
<Tracking event="progress" offset="3">
<![CDATA[http://server1.com/progress.jpg]]>
</Tracking>
<Tracking event="complete">
<![CDATA[http://server1.com/complete.jpg]]>
</Tracking>
</TrackingEvents>
```

#### 3.14.1 Tracking Event Descriptions

VAST is used to track a number of ad events using the `<TrackingEvents>` and `<Tracking>`
elements. Tracking for impressions is covered in section 3.4.3 and clickthroughs are covered
in their relevant sections. Review the schema in section 5 to find more details about tracking
the different ad types in VAST. Each `<Tracking>` element contains a URI for the tracking
resource of one event. The media player uses these URIs to notify the ad server when the
identified event occurs.
In some cases the media player cannot detect that an event has occurred unless a third
party, such as the ad creative or a verification script, communicates the event through a
framework such as OMID or VPAID. For example, the adExpand event for NonLinear ads
requires the ad to notify the media player that it has expanded. In such cases, the player
must support these tracking events to the extent that they support the individual
frameworks.
The following list of metrics is derived from the IAB Digital Video In-Stream Ad Metric
Definitions where more detailed metric definitions can be found.
The values accepted for tracking events are described in the following list:
Player Operation Metrics (for use in Linear and NonLinear Ads)
- mute: the user activated the mute control and muted the creative.
- unmute: the user activated the mute control and unmuted the creative.
- pause: the user clicked the pause control and stopped the creative.
- resume: the user activated the resume control after the creative had been stopped
or paused.
- rewind: the user activated the rewind control to access a previous point in the
creative timeline.
- skip: the user activated a skip control to skip the creative.
- playerExpand: the user activated a control to extend the player to a larger size. This
event replaces the fullscreen event per the 2014 Digital Video In-Stream Ad Metric
Definitions.
- playerCollapse: the user activated a control to reduce player to a smaller size. This
event replaces the exitFullscreen event per the 2014 Digital Video In-Stream Ad
Metric Definitions.
- notUsed: This ad was not and will not be played (e.g. it was prefetched for a particular
ad break but was not chosen for playback). This allows ad servers to reuse an ad earlier
than otherwise would be possible due to budget/frequency capping. This is a terminal
event; no other tracking events should be sent when this is used. Player support is
optional and if implemented is provided on a best effort basis as it is not technically
possible to fire this event for every unused ad (e.g. when the player itself is terminated
before playback).
Linear Ad Metrics
- loaded: This event should be used to indicate when the player considers that it has
loaded and buffered the creative’s media and assets either fully or to the extent that
it is ready to play the media
- start: This event is used to indicate that an individual creative within the ad was
loaded and playback began. As with creativeView, this event is another way of
tracking creative playback. Macros defined to describe auto-play and muted states.
- firstQuartile: The creative played continuously for at least 25% of the total duration
at normal speed.
- midpoint: The creative played continuously for at least 50% of the total duration at
normal speed.
- thirdQuartile: The creative played continuously for at least 75% of the duration at
normal speed.
- complete: The creative was played to the end at normal speed so that 100% of the
creative was played.
- otherAdInteraction: An optional metric that can capture all other user interactions
under one metric such a s hover-overs, or custom clicks. It should NOT replace
clickthrough events or other existing events like mute, unmute, pause, etc.
- progress: The creative played for a duration at normal speed that is equal to or
greater than the value provided in an additional offset attribute for the `<Tracking>`
element under Linear ads. Values can be time in the format HH:MM:SS or
HH:MM:SS.mmm or a percentage value in the format n%. Multiple progress events with
different values can be used to track multiple progress points in the linear creative
timeline. This event can be used in addition to, or instead of, the “quartile” events
(firstQuartile, midpoint, thirdQuartile, complete). The additional `<Tracking>`
offset value can be used to help track a view when an agreed upon duration or
percentage of the ad has played.
- closeLinear: The viewer has chosen to close the linear ad unit. This is currently in-
use by some of the largest mobile SDKs to mark the dismissal of the end card
companion that follows the video, as well as a close of the video itself, if applicable.
NonLinear Ad Metrics
- creativeView: Not to be confused with an impression, this event indicates that an
individual creative portion of the ad was viewed. An impression indicates that at least
a portion of the ad was displayed; however an ad may be composed of multiple
creative, or creative that only play on some platforms and not others. This event
enables ad servers to track which ad creative are viewed, and therefore, which
platforms are more common.
- acceptInvitation: The user clicked or otherwise activated a control used to pause
streaming content, which either expands the ad within the player’s viewable area or
“takes-over” the streaming content area by launching an additional portion of the ad.
An ad in video format ad is usually played upon acceptance, but other forms of
media such as games, animation, tutorials, social media, or other engaging media
are also used.
- adExpand: The user activated a control to expand the creative.
- adCollapse: The user activated a control to reduce the creative to its original
dimensions.
- minimize: The user clicked or otherwise activated a control used to minimize the ad
to a size smaller than a collapsed ad but without fully dispatching the ad from the
player environment. Unlike a collapsed ad that is big enough to display it’s message,
the minimized ad is only big enough to offer a control that enables the user to
redisplay the ad if desired.
- close: The user clicked or otherwise activated a control for removing the ad, which
fully dispatches the ad from the player environment in a manner that does not allow
the user to re-display the ad.
- overlayViewDuration: The time that the initial ad is displayed. This time is based on
the time between the impression and either the completed length of display based
on the agreement between transactional parties or a close, minimize, or accept
invitation event.
- otherAdInteraction: An optional metric that can capture all other user interactions
under one metric such a s hover-overs, or custom clicks. It should NOT replace
clickthrough events or other existing events like mute, unmute, pause, etc.
Companion Ad Metric
- creativeView: Since Companion Ads use browser technology for display, tracking
metrics can be built into the creative. The only VAST event available for tracking
companion creative is the creativeView event. This event enables ad servers to track
when companion creative are viewed.
#### 3.14.2 TrackingEvents

The `<TrackingEvents>` element is available for Linear, NonLinear, and Companion,
elements in both InLine and Wrapper formats. When the media player detects that a
specified event occurs, the media player is required to trigger the tracking resource URI
provided in the nested `<Tracking>` element. When the server receives this request, it
records the event and the time it occurred.
**Player Support Required under supported ad types**
**Required in Response No**
Parent Linear

Companion
Bounded 0-1
Sub-elements Tracking
#### 3.14.3 Tracking

Each `<Tracking>` element is used to define a single event to be tracked. Multiple tracking
elements may be used to define multiple events to be tracked, but may also be used to
track events of the same type for multiple parties.
When using the progress event, an offset attribute for linear ads can be used to notify the
ad server when the ad's progress has reached the identified percentage or time value
indicated. When percentages are used, the progress event can offer tracking that represent
the quartile events (firstQuartile, midpoint, thirdQuartile, and complete).
When skippable ads are supported, the progress event is used to identify when the ad
counts as a view even if the ad is skipped. For example, if the tracking offset is set to
00:00:15 (15 seconds) but the ad is skipped after 20 seconds, then a creativeView event
may be recorded for the Linear creative.
If adType is “audio” or “hybrid”, progress events should be fired even if the media playback
is in the background.
The offset attribute is only available for the `<Tracking>` element under `<Linear>`.
**Player Support Required under supported ad types**
**Required in Response No**
Parent TrackingEvents for both InLine and Wrapper formats

Attributes Description
event A string that defines the event being tracked. Accepted values are listed in section
#### 3.14.1 and differ for <Linear>, <NonLinear>, and <Companion>.

offset Only available when `<Linear>` is the parent. Accepts values of time in the format
HH:MM:SS or as a percentage in the format n%. When the progress of the Linear
creative has matched the value specified, the included URI is triggered. If the
duration is not known when the offset is set to a percentage value, the progress
event may be ignored.
### 3.15 Creative Resource Files for Non-Video and Non-Audio

Creative

NonLinear ads, Companions, and Industry Icons are non-video and non-audio creative, so
creative files are nested using elements that define the type of creative resource file
provided: StaticResource, IFrameResource, and HTMLResource.
These resource nodes are available under the elements: `<NonLinear>`, `<Companion>`, and

```xml
<Icon> in the InLine format; however, in Wrapper format, resource files may only be
```

provided under the `<Companion>` and `<Icon>` elements. NonLinear elements in Wrapper
format are only used for tracking, and resource files are not allowed.
Multiple creative files may be included using these components, but each element should
contain one or more files to represent different versions of the creative for use in different
environments. The media player can choose which file to use when more than one resource
file is provided within a single container.
For example, if an ad server wants to submit both a static image and an HTML creative for
a NonLinear ad, then the NonLinear portion of the VAST response would be formatted as
follows:

```xml
<NonLinearAds>
<NonLinear>
<StaticResource>
<![CDATA[http://adserver.com/staticresourcefile.jpg]]>
</StaticResource>
<HTMLResource>
<![CDATA[http://adserver.com/htmlresourcefile.htm]]>
</HTMLResource>
</NonLinear>
</NonLinearAds>
```

The three resource file elements are described in the following sections.
#### 3.15.1 StaticResource

The URI to a static creative file to be used for the ad component identified in the parent
element, which is either: `<NonLinear>`, `<Companion>`, or `<Icon>`.

### 3.16 AdVerifications

The `<AdVerifications>` element contains one or more `<Verification>` elements, which
list the resources and metadata required to execute third-party measurement code in order
to verify creative playback.The `<AdVerifications>` element is used to contain one or more

```xml
<Verification> elements, which are used to initiate a controlled container where code can
```

be executed for collecting data to verify ad playback details.

### 3.17 Verification

The `<Verification>` element contains the executable and bootstrapping data required to
run the measurement code for a single verification vendor. Multiple `<Verification>`
elements may be listed, in order to support multiple vendors, or if multiple API frameworks
are supported. At least one `<JavaScriptResource>` or `<ExecutableResource>` should be
provided. At most one of these resources should selected for execution, as best matches
the technology available in the current environment.
If the player is willing and able to run one of these resources, it should execute them
BEFORE creative playback begins. Otherwise, if no resource can be executed, any
appropriate tracking events listed under the `<Verification>` element must be fired.

#### 3.17.1 JavaScriptResource

A container for the URI to the JavaScript file used to collect verification data.
Some verification vendors may provide JavaScript executables which work in non-browser
environments, for example, in an iOS app enabled by JavaScriptCore. These resources
only require methods of the API framework, without relying on any browser built-in
functionality.
Players that execute verification code in a browser or webview context should prefer
browserOptional="false" resources if both are available, but may also execute
browserOptional="true" resources. Players that execute verification code in a non-
browser environment (e.g. JavaScriptCore) may only execute resources marked
browserOptional="true". If only browserOptional="false" resources are provided, the
player must trigger any provided verificationNotExecuted tracking events with reason
code 2, to indicate the provided code is not supported (see Section 3.17.4).

#### 3.17.4 Tracking

Each `<Tracking>` element is used to define a single event to be tracked by the verification
vendor. Multiple tracking elements may be used to define multiple events to be tracked, but
may also be used to track events of the same type for multiple parties.
One event type is currently supported:
- verificationNotExecuted: The player did not or was not able to execute the provided
verification code
The following macros should be supported specifically in URIs for this event type (in
addition to all macros from the global macro set in section 6).
- [REASON] - The reason code corresponding to the cause of the failure.
| Reason Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Verification resource rejected. The publisher does not recognize or allow code from the vendor in the parent `<Verification>`. |
| 2 | Verification not supported. The API framework or language type of verification resources provided are not implemented or supported by the player/SDK. |
| 3 | Error during resource load. The player/SDK was not able to fetch the verification resource, or some error occurred that the player/SDK was able to detect. Examples of detectable errors: malformed resource URLs, 404 or other failed response codes, request time out.

### 3.18 Extensions

Ad servers can use this XML node for custom extensions of VAST. When used, custom
XML should fall under the nested `<Extension>` (singular) element so that custom XML can
be separated from VAST elements. An XML namespace (xmlns) should also be used for
the custom extension to separate it from VAST components.
The following example includes a custom XML element within the `<Extensions>` element.

```xml
<Extensions>
<Extension>
<CustomXML>…</CustomXML>
<Extension>
</Extensions>
```

The publisher must be aware of and be capable of executing any VAST extensions in order
to process the content.

### 3.19 Wrapper

VAST Wrappers are used to redirect the media player to another server for either an
additional `<Wrapper>` or the VAST `<InLine>` ad. In addition to the URI that points to another
file, the Wrapper may contain tracking elements that provide tracking for the InLine ad that
is served following one or more wrappers. A Wrapper may also contain `<Companion>`
creative and `<Icon>` creative. And while `<Linear>` and `<NonLinear>` elements are available
in the Wrapper, they are only used for tracking. No media files are provided for Linear
elements, nor are resource files provided for NonLinear elements. Other elements offered
for InLine ads may not be offered for Wrappers.
To find out if an element is offered for Wrappers, check the human-readable schema in
section 5.

Attributes Description
followAdditionalWrappers a Boolean value that identifies whether subsequent Wrappers after a
requested VAST response is allowed. If false, any Wrappers received (i.e. not
an Inline VAST response) should be ignored. Otherwise, VAST Wrappers
received should be accepted (default value is “true.”)
allowMultipleAds a Boolean value that identifies whether multiple ads are allowed in the
requested VAST response. If true, both Pods and stand-alone ads are allowed.
If false, only the first stand-alone Ad (with no sequence values) in the
requested VAST response is allowed. Default value is “false.”
Attributes Description
fallbackOnNoAd a Boolean value that provides instruction for using an available Ad when the
requested VAST response returns no ads. If true, the media player should
select from any stand-alone ads available. If false and the Wrapper represents
an Ad in a Pod, the media player should move on to the next Ad in a Pod;
otherwise, the media player can follow through at its own discretion where
no-ad responses are concerned.
#### 3.19.1 VASTAdTagURI

While VAST Wrappers don’t provide all the same elements offered for an InLine ad, the

```xml
<VASTAdTagURI> is the only element that is unique to Wrappers. The VASTAdTagURI is used
```

to provide a URI to a secondary VAST response. This secondary response may be another
Wrapper, but eventually a VAST wrapper must return an `<InLine>` ad. In VAST 4 the player
is only required to accept five wrappers ads. If no InLine ads are returned after 5 Wrappers,
the player may move on to the next option.
**Player Support Required**
**Required in Response Yes (if `<Wrapper>` is used)**
Parent Wrapper
Bounded 1 (if `<Wrapper>` is used)
Content A URI to a VAST response that may be another VAST Wrapper or a VAST InLine ad.
The number of VAST wrappers should not exceed 5 before an InLine ad is served.
After 5 VAST wrapper responses, acceptance of additional VAST responses is at the
publisher’s discretion.
#### 3.19.2 BlockedAdCategories

Ad categories are used in creative separation and for compliance in certain programs. In a
wrapper, this field defines ad categories that cannot be returned by a downstream ad
server. This value is used to populate the [BLOCKEDADCATEGORIES] request macro in
VASTAdTagURI strings, and can also be used by the player to reject InLine ads with
Category fields that violate the BlockedAdCategories fields of upstream wrappers. If an
InLine ad is skipped due to a category violation, the client must notify the ad server using
the `<Error>` URI, if provided (error code 205), and move on to the next option.
**Player Support Optional**
**Required in Response No***
Parent Wrapper
Bounded 0+
Content A string that provides comma separated list of category codes or labels per
authority that identify the ad content.
Attributes Description
authority * A URL for the organizational authority that produced the list being used to identify
ad content.
*Optional unless the publisher requires ad categories. The authority attribute is required if categories
are provided.
## 4 Migration to VAST 4.x

VAST 4 offers features to support long-form video, server-side tracking, industry-wide
creative tracking, and viewability and verification tracking. While the advance in features is
alluring, media players will need time to upgrade their systems. During the transition period
from VAST 3.0 to 4 (or 2.0 to 4), prepare to manage varying feature support in the market.
VAST 4 was designed to be backward compatible with version 3.0 and VAST 3.0 was
designed to be backwards compatible with version 2.0.
However, features introduced in the newer versions will typically not be back ported to
older-versioned players. Also, features explicitly called out as deprecated or removed will
break backward compatibility.
The following sections outline a few notes to consider as VAST 4 is introduced into the
market.
### 4.1 Advertisers and Ad Technology Vendors

Design ads that can be successfully delivered to lower versioned VAST players while still
optimizing the response with new 4 capabilities. For example:
- VAST 4 ads discourage the use of VPAID or other interactive ad units that require an
API to execute in the `<MediaFile>`. The new `<InteractiveCreativeFile>` was
provided to accommodate such ads. However, in older versions, an interactive unit
may be provided in addition to the video `<MediaFile>` in order to ensure interactive
files are executed where possible in older VAST version players.
- In a 4 response, use both the Creative adId attribute as well as the new

```xml
<UniversalAdId> element to provide a creative ad ID.
```

### 4.2 Ad Servers and Networks

Be prepared to manage the variability with VAST versions. For example, if a player
specifically requests a VAST 3.0 response, then the ad server should limit responses to
VAST 3.0.
If one or more verification vendors are involved, use VAST 4 to provide verification code in
the new <AdVerification> node, but expect that older versioned players will not recognize
the verification node.
An important change discussed during 4.1 is the concept of standardized ad requests using
AdCOM and POST requests. This is something that likely will require a phased approach on
ad servers and so should be planned accordingly. The group recommends that servers start
supporting POST requests (in addition to GET requests) in the near future and look into
related scaling issues, because the AdCOM based ad request support will be developed
next.
### 4.3 Media Players

VAST 4 players should continue to accept ads on older versions of VAST because it will
take time for the entire industry to upgrade.

## 6 Macros

### 6.1 Introduction

Ad servers and other entities need access to additional data from the publisher to meet
client needs for a clearer view into the details of how and where their video is being shown.
The following macros enable the media player to provide these additional data points. Some
may need to be relayed from the publisher ad server to the player in turn before the player
can pass them on.
The following overview outlines the various macros, in which contexts they are applicable
and their meaning.
Macro Formatting and Replacement
All macro names are surrounded by square brackets, for example:[EXAMPLE]. When
replacing the macro with a value, the whole name - including brackets - needs to be
replaced with the value.
For example, if you’d want to replace the [EXAMPLE] macro in the URL
https://mydomain.com/something?test=[EXAMPLE] with the value somevalue,
you would get https://mydomain.com/something?test=somevalue
Macro Replacement Responsibility
The responsibility to properly replace macros with their proper values lies with the party that
will perform the HTTP request.
In the most common scenario, both for VAST URLs and tracking pixel URLs, this would be
the video player that’s executing the ad.
In some cases a server might perform the macro replacement on behalf of the video player,
for example in the case of server-side ad insertion where the server is performing tracking
pixel requests on behalf of the client.
Marking Macro Values as Unknown or Unavailable
For any macros that are marked as optional or deprecated and where the actual macro is
not provided, the following special values must be inserted into the macro to indicate the
reason for not providing the information:
If the macro value is... Then replace macro with...
Value is unknown, but would be shared if it was -1
known
Value is known, but information can't be shared -2
because of policy (unwilling to share)
> Implementation Note: do not replace all unknown macros with -1, only do this for macros
specifically mentioned in this section that you decide not to implement.
Macro Value URI Encoding
Some macros must be populated as a series of values rather than a single value. These
macros use the Array<T> data type. This is a list of T values where T is another data type
like string or integer. When replacing a macro with such a list, the value should be
rendered as a set of values separated by a comma (","), and no spacing. For example: the
values stringA and stringB would be encoded as stringA,stringB.
When replacing macros, make sure to apply encodeURIComponent to any value, to avoid
creating invalid URLs. However, note that encoding should be applied to individual values
only, not the entire macro replacement string (i.e. unencoded commas should separate
distinct values).
For example, to encode the values abc/def and y=z, you’d replace the macro with
abc%2Fdef,y%3Dz
Note that each individual value is properly encoded, but the comma between values is not.
In the examples given below, if the URI-encoded version differs from the unencoded
original, both are given for the sake of clarity. However, the encoded version must always
be used as a macro substitution.

Name [ADCOUNT]
Type integer
Introduced In VAST 4.1
Support Status Optional
Contexts All tracking pixels
VAST request URIs
Description For VAST requests: the number of ads expected by the player
For tracking pixels: the number of `<InLine>` ads played within the current chain
or tree of VASTs, including the executing one. That is, this value starts at 1 and
increments for each video played, whether it was pulled from a Pod, buffet, nested
Pod, etc. In standard non-Pod VAST responses with a single `<InLine>` ad, this
value is always 1.
Example 2
Example: A VAST containing an Ad Pod with two ads with a buffet of three standalone ads.

```xml
<VAST>
<Ad sequence="1" id="one">...</Ad>
<Ad sequence="2" id="two">...</Ad>
<Ad id="three">...</Ad>
<Ad id="four">...</Ad>
<Ad id="five">...</Ad>
</VAST>
```

The player plays ads "one" and "two" from the Pod, then chooses to also play ad "four". The player would
fill the [ADCOUNT] macro with "1", "2 and "3" respectively for tracking events during playback of the
individual ads. The [PODSEQUENCE] value would be "1", "2", and "".

## 7 VAST Terminology

As the video and audio advertising industry has evolved, certain terminology has gained
widespread adoption. The following definitions represent some of that terminology as it
relates to video and audio ad serving discussed in this document.
Ad Pod: An Ad Pod is sequence of Linear ads played back-to-back, like a commercial
break with multiple ad spots on TV.
Companion Ad: Commonly a display banner or rich media ad that appears on the page
outside of the media player. Companion Ads may remain on the page after the related in-
stream ad ends. A Companion Ad can also be a skin that wraps the video or audio
experience.
Clickthrough: A URL for page that opens when a user clicks the ad creative.
InLine Ad: A VAST ad response that contains all the information needed to play the video
or audio ad. No additional calls to other ad servers are needed after a VAST InLine ad
response is received.
In-Stream Ad: Any ad that appears inside a streaming media player, whether it’s an image
overlay or a Linear video or audio ad, such as an ad that plays in a 30 second ad spot.
Linear Ad: Linear Ads are like TV or Radio commercials and can appear before the content
video/audio plays (pre-roll), during a break in the content video/audio (mid-roll), or after the
content video/audio ends(post-roll). Linear ads may be video/audio, rich media or still image
ads. Using an API or other technology, Linear ads can be interactive and ad duration can be
extended when a user interacts.
Master Ad: For video or audio ad campaigns that include an in-stream ad plus one or more
Companion ads, the in-stream portion of the ad unit is referred to as the master ad. In this
master-companion relationship, the master ad must always be shown.
NonLinear Ad: An in-stream ad that appears concurrently with the video or audio content
playback. NonLinear ads usually cover the bottom or top fifth of the media player and can
be text, image or interactive ads. Using an API or other technology, the media player may
allow user-initiated interaction in a NonLinear ad to stop content video/audio playback.
NonLinear ads can only appear at some point between content video/audio start and end
(mid-roll positions) and generally disappear after 10-20 seconds if there is no interaction.
[Note: NonLinear ads have failed to achieve scale in the market.
Overlay Ad: A NonLinear ad format in which an image or text displays on top of video
content. Overlay ads are commonly referred to as simply “NonLinear Ads;” however
NonLinear Ads may also include non-overlay formats that are served within the media
player but without covering any video content.
Primary Ad Server: The first ad server that the media player calls to for ad content. The
primary ad server is usually the ad server used by the publisher.
Secondary Ad Server: The ad server that the media player calls after receiving a VAST
redirect (Wrapper) from the primary ad server. Secondary ad servers may include agency or
ad network ad servers. Also, secondary ad servers may redirect the media player to a third
ad server and the third ad server may redirect to a fourth, and so on. Eventually, an ad
server must provide a VAST response that includes all the creative elements needed to
display the ad.
VAMG: Video Ad Measurement Guidelines is an IAB guideline that defines the set of events
that should be tracked when a video ad is played.
VAST: The Video Ad Serving Template is an IAB guideline and XML schema that describes
the XML structure for a video or audio ad response. VAST enables ad responses to come
from any ad server.
VAST Redirect: A VAST ad response that points to another VAST response (sometimes
referred to as the downstream VAST response).
VAST Tag: A URI that returns a VAST response when called.
Video Ad: Any ad displayed in the context of a video experience. A video experience may
include in-banner video, in-text video, in-stream video and other formats. VAST applies only
to in-stream video where a media player is used to manage the video experience
independent of any other content. For example, video served within an ad banner is
considered rich media and is NOT addressed in the VAST guideline.
Media Player: A media playback environment used to manage a video or audio experience.
Media players are provided by an Online Video Platform (OVP) vendor or can be custom-
built by the publisher.
VMAP: Video Multi Ads Playlist is an IAB guideline that describes the XML structure for a
playlist of video ads sent from an ad server to a media player.
VPAID: Video Player Ad Interface Definition is an IAB guideline that defines the
communication protocols between an interactive ad and the media player that is rendering
it.
Wrapper: in the context of VAST, a Wrapper is a response that provides a URI that the
media player uses to call a secondary VAST response. The secondary response may be
either another Wrapper or a VAST InLine response.
