## 8.1.3 Security

VPAID uses the ad rendering approach as described in the "IAB Best Practice for Rich Media Ads in Asynchronous Ad Documents" found at the following link for further review:

The VPAID ad unit is rendered within a friendly IFRAME (FIF) and can access the DOM of the page in which the player is rendered.

As modern technology further enables isolation between the display ad and the publisher page content, IAB will embark on developing specifications for enhanced security and VPAID will be updated to incorporate applicable security recommendations.
